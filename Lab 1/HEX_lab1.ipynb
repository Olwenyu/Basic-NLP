            "EXAMINING DIFFERENT SCHOOL STRUCTURES’ EFFECT ON REDUCING THE ACHIEVEMENT GAP BETWEEN AFRICAN-AMERICAN AND WHITE STUDENTSA thesis submitted in partial fulfillment of the requirements for the degree of Masters of EducationByERIC WILLIAM REINIB.A. Education, Cedarville University, 19952004Cedarville UniversityABSTRACTReini, Eric William. M.Ed. Education Department, Cedarville University, 2004. Examining Different School Structures’ effect on Reducing the Achievement Gap Between African-American and White Students.The fact that an achievement gap between White and African- American students exists is undisputed. The reasons for this gap are many and complex. Evidence does exist, though, that this gap can be narrowed and potentially eliminated. Evidence also exists that demonstrates that when the gap in academic achievement becomes equal African-Americans are more likely to complete college and earn nearly the same income as Whites. Educators must understand the many reasons for the achievement gap and find ways to narrow the gap and further ensure the future success of all students. It is the purpose for this thesis to explore the reasons for the achievement gap and some possible solutions for narrowing the gap. Specifically, the paper will show one possible solution – the Academy structure.TABLE OF CONTENTSACKNOWLEDGEMENTSMany individuals have helped and encouraged me as I have worked to complete graduate school and the writing of this thesis. I owe them all a huge “thank you.”I would like to thank all of my professors at Cedarville University and Colombia International University who have challenged my thinking and helped me to improve as an educator.Dr. Ed Baumann, thank you for opening my eyes and mind to the realities of my students lives in the inner-city. Also, thank you for allowing me to first pursue this topic in your Social Diversities class.Dr. Phil Bassett, thank you for modeling the importance of adapting and creatively modifying instructional strategies in the classroom.Dr. Stephen Gruber, thank you for providing guidance and instruction on how to approach the thesis writing process.To Dawn Heideman, my team teacher, thank you for being an excellent teacher. You have inspired me to be better at what I do for the sake of the students with whom we work. This process was possible due in large part to the sacrifice and planning you do in running our successful freshman academy.To my administrators, Ed Johnson and Karen Zalac, thanks for using your expertise to implement and run a successful academy program at East High School. Thank you for supporting me as a teacher and us as an academy. You are a vital part in our success.To my daughters, Petra and Katriella, thank you so much. Even though you are too young to truly understand this undertaking, you have sacrificed much time and attention because daddy was at class or studying. I love you both like crazy!To my mom, Janet Reini, thank you for your support, encouragement, and training over the years. I owe much of who I am today to you.To my dad, George Reini, thank you for helping me to learn to think. Thank you for training me from an early age the importance of education.To my in-laws, Robert and Cynthia Thompson, I am so thankful that I am a part of your family. You have provided so much encouragement for which I am extremely grateful. You both are great role-models for us.To my Lord, Jesus Christ, thank you for loving me despite who I am and what I do. Your faithfulness is complete and I trust you fully. Thank you for providing strength and encouragement to complete this project.DEDICATIONI am dedicating this thesis to my best friend and wife, Diana. She knows me inside and out and yet she loves me with a devotion that is simply incredible to me. She has supported me completely throughout graduate school. Without her help and undying support I would have never completed this program. Diana, thank you for your love. I love you.Chapter 1: IntroductionEducational SignificanceThere exists a well known and well documented academic achievement gap between white students and minority students. The gap is evident in test scores, graduation rates, and appears across the curriculum. It was narrowing through the decades of the 70’s and 80’s, but, in the 1990’s, the gap has widened somewhat. “By the end of high school, in fact, African American and Latino students have skills in both reading and mathematics that are the same as those of white students in the 8th grade.” (Haycock, 2001) According to the Ohio Department of Education, the data showing 6th graders who met the minimum state performance standards in reading and mathematics proficiency testing for 2000-01 revealed the glaring disparity amongst racial groups. In the mathematics section, 68.4 percent of white students met the standard compared to25.8 percent of African American students. In reading, 65.3 percent of white students met the standard compared to 25.0 percent of African American students. (Gehring, 2002) SAT scores revealed the continued inequality into the high school age as the average scores for white students on the verbal and math portions were 506 and 514 respectively in 2001, whereas African American students scored an average of 433 and 426 respectively. (Roach, 2001) The academic achievement gap between white students and minorities, particularly African Americans, is well documented.This data calls the researcher to question why this achievement gap exists and persists. There appears to be several factors that play a role in establishing the gap. Some of the factors are student related like poverty, family and community support, and negative peer pressure (Alson, 2003). There are also many factors that involve the school’s responsibility for the gap which include high standards, a challenging curriculum, extra help for students, teacher quality, and instructional quality. The focus of this paper will be the school’s role in eliminating or at least narrowing the gap.PurposeThe purpose of the research is to examine the achievement gap between White students and African American students and to evaluate a specific school structure’s effectiveness in narrowing the gap. The researcher will answer the question; does the Academy (school within a school) structure significantly reduce the achievement gap between African American and White students? The research will explain the educational challenges facing the African American student and describe some school related solutions for raising the achievement of these students.The challenges presented in narrowing the achievement gap and raising equity for all students must be confronted by schools. There is much work to be done and several key issues need to be addressed to improve the quality of education at all schools. Teacher and instructional quality must be a priority especially in high minority school settings where the achievement gap is prevalent. Schools with the most needs tend to not retain effective teachers and administrators.  This affects the quality of instructionpresented and facilitates an increasing achievement gap between white and minority students.Comprehensive school reform is necessary in many cases so that schools get organized in their approaches to counteracting the gap. Th reform makes possible changes needed in what is taught, how it is taught, and how it is assessed on a school- wide instead of class by class level (Codding, 2000). Comprehensive school reform affects all aspects at all levels of a school including leadership, management, organization, climate, use of money, and use of human resources. There are many models for comprehensive school reform, but this research will focus on the Academy (school within a school) structure and its’ effectiveness in narrowing the achievement gap.MethodologyIn order to answer the question of the efficiency of various school structures, specifically the Academy model, in improving the achievement gap, the paper will begin with an in depth look at the various literature written on the topic of the achievement gap. It attempts to read and assimilate the views and information out there regarding this topic. It will also attempt to identify possible causes and solutions for the achievement gap. The author accessed most of the previously conducted research through the ERIC database, Academic Search Premier, current journals, and the World Wide Web.The method of research will involve a correlative examination of two ninth grade classes at an urban high school whose demographic makeup consists of approximately 99 percent African American students. The classes will be evaluated in terms of state proficiency testing, academic achievement, and attendance. The first class evaluated will be the freshman class during the 1999-2000 school year who were a traditional freshman class. This will be the control group. The second class evaluated will be the freshman class during the 2002-03 school year because they had the full advantages afforded them in an organized, fully functioning Academy called the Freshman Success Academy. This will be the treatment group. Both of these classes will be evaluated to see if there is improvement in achievement with the Academy, and also if the Academy was successful in narrowing the achievement gap between African American and White students.Biblical IntegrationGod created every human in a unique and wonderful way. His plan was very specific as to the natural characteristics, personalities, aptitudes, and abilities according to Psalm 139:13-16. In Galatians 3:28 it says, “There is neither Jew nor Greek (racial differentiation), slave nor free (socioeconomic differentiation), male nor female (gender differentiation), for you are all one in Christ Jesus.” Equity in school is Biblical. This does not necessarily mean that all students should achieve at the same level as every individual is created uniquely. It does suggest that all students should have the same opportunity to achieve. The opportunity should include equity in teacher quality, curriculum quality, quality of instruction, and resources that are available.  Theopportunity should be the same for all students regardless of race, gender, or socioeconomic class.The education professional must be characterized by excellence because the stakes are so high. The profession works everyday with the future lives of children. The work done should be completed in such a way that lives are touched everyday and God is glorified through the efforts and the motivations exemplified in the profession. Colossians 3:23 says, “Whatever you do, work at it with all your heart, as working for the Lord, not for men.” The teaching profession must have people who are willing to work with all of their hearts in helping all students achieve their fullest potential. This is what is honoring to God.SettingEast High School in Columbus, Ohio is an urban high school whose population consists of almost all African American students. The school has implemented the Academy structure in the form of Career Academies. This was accomplished through grant money and an initiative called High Schools that Work.The general model consists of students entering the freshman year in a general college preparatory academy, and then at the end of their freshman year they choose a career academy that lines up with their career goals. The model is data-driven and involves breaking a large school population up into smaller units comparable to schools within a school. Teachers collaborate throughout the year by utilizing a common planning period. The goal is to cultivate relationships amongst and with the students thatcreate a safe and warm environment for the students. The purpose is to increase student achievement.SummaryThe presentation of research will examine the achievement gap existing between White and African American students. The reader will come to understand the breadth of the problem as well as many of the factors playing a role in the achievement gap. The reader will be presented with many of the issues needing to be addressed by schools in the effort to reach all students and raise achievement. The current Academy school structure will be evaluated as to whether or not it is a viable vehicle of comprehensive school reform in raising the achievement of African American students to a level more closely paralleling that of White students.Chapter 2: Literature ReviewSignificanceFor decades researchers have discussed and debated the lower levels of educational achievement of African-American compared with White students. This achievement gap exists in all school ages. Even when students arrive at kindergarten, the African-American students are considerably behind their White peers in measurable cognitive skills (Nettles, 2003, p.215).There is an endless list of possible reasons for this racial divide in achievement levels ranging from the following: linguistic incongruities between home and school culture; differing levels of parental involvement; lack of cultural and social capital; lower general socio-economic status; divergent study habits and motivational levels; the fear of “acting white”; lower teacher expectations, and the quantity and quality of material they are exposed to (Nettles, 2003, p. 216).Statistics regarding the existence of an achievement gap.Between 1970 and 1988, the achievement gap between African-American and White students declined continuously until it was cut by fifty percent. Then, throughout the 1990’s, the achievement gap began to widen again. To explain this widening of the gap, it is necessary to closely examine what is going on (Haycock, 2001, p.6).There are several achievement patterns which are worthy of noting. In 1999, 1 in 100 African-American 17-year-olds can read and gather information from a specialized text (such as a science article in a magazine) compared to 1 in 12 White students. 1 in 100 African-American students can comfortably solve multi-step problems compared to about 1 in 10 White students. The ratio of African-American students to White students who are able to compute fractions, solve percents, and calculate averages was 30 percent to 70 percent. In the 18-24 age group, 90 percent of Whites have either completed high school or earned a GED while the percentage of African-Americans drops to 81. Approximately 76 percent of White high school graduates go directly to college, while 71 percent of African-Americans will go. African-Americans are only half as likely to earn a bachelors degree by the age of 29 as Whites. These statistics do indicate an achievement gap trend between races (Haycock, 2001, p.7).Achievement Gap Statistics for Ohio SchoolsIn Ohio, the statistics are just as alarming. For example, in 7th grade, only 11 percent of African-American students passed all five parts of the states new proficiency test, compared with 43 percent of White students. In 2001, only 59 percent of African- American students graduated from high school, compared with 85 percent of White students. Data released comparing sixth graders were as follows: students passing the math proficiency test – 68.4 percent of White students and 25.8 percent of African-American students; and students passing the reading proficiency test – 65.3 percent of White students and 25.0 percent of African-American students (Gehring, 2002, pp.20- 21).Also in Ohio, 79 percent of White 9th graders performed at or above the passing rate for the Ohio 9th Grade Math Proficiency Test, compared to only 38 percent of the African-American 9th graders. This means that 62 percent of African-American 9th graders in Ohio are not passing, compared to only 21 percent of White 9th graders. According to the 2000 National Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP), Ohio’s African-American-White achievement gap falls 11th among all of the states. This puts Ohio in the top quartile among states on the NAEP math assessment (The Education Trust, 2003).The achievement gap is also apparent in the number of students successfully taking Advanced Placement (AP) courses and the end of the year exams. In 2000-2001, of the students taking AP exams in Ohio, 4 percent of the test-takers were African- American and 89 percent of them were White on the Calculus AB exam. Of the students taking the exam, 31 percent of the African-American students earned scores of 3, 4, or 5 (passing scores), compared to 69 percent of White students. On the AP English Language and Composition exam, 5 percent of the test-takers were African-American and 90 percent were White, and, of those who took this exam, the number of passers was similar - 31 percent African-American and 68 percent White. Finally, in the AP Biology course, 4 percent of the course-takers were African-American and 85 percent were White.The number of students passing the exam was as follows: 15 percent of the African- American students and 57 percent of the White students passed (The Education Trust, 2003).Data gathered from the SAT college achievement test also indicated a gap between African-American and White high school seniors. On the math portion of the test, the average score in 2001 for White students taking the test was 531 compared to an average score of 426 for African-American students. The gap is obvious in the average verbal scores as well; White students earned a 529 while African-Americans earned a 433 average score. College Board President Gaston Caperton responded to this data saying, “The score gaps for different racial, ethnic, and socioeconomic groups that we see on the SAT also appear on virtually every measure of achievement, including other standardized tests and classroom grades, and they show up as early as fourth grade. These differences are a powerful illustration of a persistent social problem in our country: inequitable access to high-quality education (Roach, 2001, p. 12).”According to two international surveys, the Trends in International Mathematics and Science Study (TIMSS) and the Program for International Student Assessment (PISA), the gap between low achievers and average students persist internationally. The gap does not seem to be dependent upon the wealth and prosperity of the country. Wealthier countries such as Portugal, Italy, and the United States have a much higher achievement gap than many poorer countries such as South Korea. The study notes thatstudent achievement seems to be closely linked to the students’ family backgrounds (Borja, 2002, p. 10).Data indicates the achievement gap is accompanied by a teacher gap. Quality Counts 2003 is a report, compiled by Richard Ingersoll of the University of Pennsylvania, analyzing public school students’ access to qualified teachers. The data reveals 32 percent of high school students in high-poverty schools take a class with a teacher that did not even minor in the subject that he or she teaches, compared to only 22 percent in low poverty schools. This percentage increases to more than 50 percent in the middle school grades in high poverty schools, compared to 44 percent in low poverty schools. 70 percent of students in low poverty secondary schools have teachers who have both majored in and become licensed in the subjects they teach, compared to about 50 percent of high poverty schools. Finally, students in high poverty schools are more likely to be taught by less-experienced teachers. Less than 9 percent of teachers in low poverty schools have fewer than 3 years of teaching experience, whereas more than 13 percent of teachers in high poverty schools have little teaching experience (Heimel, 2003, p.18).The issue of “white flight” to non-public schools and its’ affect on public schools is a possible concern which may be affecting achievement in certain school settings. After several statistical analyses, there does seem to be a correlation between the percentage of white students enrolled in non-public schools and the concentration of minorities in the public schools. Secondly, white enrollment does make a difference inthe public schools. “The black-white gap is greater in districts with many whites in non- public schools (Bankston, Caldas, 2000, pp. 539-550).”Analysis of the Statistics.Historically, African-American youth have been thought to have done better if they adopted a Eurocentric cultural value system. In order for them to achieve, they had to “act white.” The findings of this study were these students showed high self-esteem and achievement goals in conjunction with Afro-centricity. The findings revealed that when achievement test scores were the measure of performance, the low scores were associated with the Eurocentric racial attitudes. On the contrary, high self-esteem and achievement goals were associated with an Afro-centric view of self (Spencer, 2001, pp. 21-30).A study was completed that measured the gap between ethnic groups by assessing data on the National Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP) and SAT results. It offered an in depth look at the available data on the Black-White and Hispanic- White gap in the areas of reading and mathematics. It sought to answer the question as to why the gap seemed to decrease in the 1970’s and early 1980’s but then appeared to widen again in the 1990’s. The study addresses many factors perceived as reasons for these phenomena such as: changes in socioeconomic and family conditions, changes in youth culture and student behaviors, and changes in schooling conditions and practices.The study concludes that much ground overall has been covered in narrowing the racial and ethnic gap over the last three decades. It appears that many of the gains made duringthe first two decades occurred at the basic skills level and then the gap grew again when the emphasis shifted toward the advanced skills level during the 1980’s. The study states that the factors that have been attributed to the gap do not easily explain the current widening of the gap and that further research is necessary across multiple fields of study (Lee, 2002, pp. 3-12).Another study attempted to identify if after school activities affected achievement of 8th and 10th grade students and students of different ethnicity. They looked at the two opposing views on the subject – zero-sum concept (extra activities just take time away from students that they should use to study) and the view that these activities provide an experience that contributes to the overall development of the student. The study used the National Education Longitudinal Study (NELS 1988) and it included 8th and 10th grade students whose data on the test were complete. The study evaluated the students’ scores in several content areas and categorized the students’ pursuits on the basis of in or out of school, academic or nonacademic, and organized or nonorganized. The study concluded that academic pursuits seemed to be consistently related to achievement, while nonacademic pursuits were not significantly related to achievement. These results indicated that the affect was different among differing ethnicities, but it did not go into any depth with this observation (Schreiber, 2002, pp. 10-100).Another study compares the educational expectations of parents and the influence these expectations have on students of different races. The authors differentiate between the whites and the African-American/Hispanic in that the expectations are generallyhigher. The exception to this is the African-American father due to the lack of a father figure in most cases. The conclusion was as follows: “As we have shown, the aspirations of close relatives and parents, but not those of teachers and peers, have differential effects on students’ educational expectations, pointing to the importance of examining the unique family and social contexts in which students of different races live in America (Cheng, 2002, pp. 306-327).”In another study, evidence is described which shows achievement gaps in mathematics between Black and White students. The study also examined how the socio- economic status (SES) of the students affects the gap. It found SES had little affect in the disparity of achievement levels. The gap had narrowed for nearly two decades during the 1970’s and the 1980’s, but started widening again during the 1990’s. The researcher evaluated the differences in instructional practices in primarily white and black classrooms. The research identified some key differences in instructional belief and practices between teachers of White and Black students. Teachers of White students focused more on reasoning skills and problem solving, whereas teachers of black students focused on single solution and drill-based instructional strategies. There were also discrepancies found in student course taking and beliefs between these two groups. The study concluded there are disparities between Black and White students’ achievement, and this is regardless of their SES status (Lubienski, 2002, pp.269-287).Another study took a quantitative approach to show evidence that, for black and white students, environment (American vs. foreign born) plays a decisive role indetermining their success in precalculus. They showed the preparation in “Later Skills” (the math skills most necessary for success in advanced math courses) was further achieved by those who were foreign born. The study involved a sample from a public university in New York with 2,005 students who were broken down by gender, ethnicity, age, and birthplace. The instrument used was a CEEB Elementary Algebra Skills Test. The study took place at a four year college. They then compared the scores achieved on the test to the grade performance in precalculus. The conclusion was that foreign-born students were better prepared than American Whites, Blacks, and Hispanics in the “Later Skills.” Therefore, the results point to the environment playing a decisive role in the development of “Later Skills” and, thus, subsequent success in precalculus (Baranchik, 2002, pp. 253-267).Even long after the 1954 U.S. Supreme Court decision in Brown v. Board of Education, segregated schools continue due to a combination of continued residential segregation and the tradition of neighborhood school assignment. Over 67 percent of African-American students attend majority minority schools and 33 percent attend schools with more than 90 percent minority enrollment. On the other hand, over 90 percent of White students attend school in White majority districts. This has led to serious negative ramifications for most African-American students. Majority minority school districts have a more difficult time attracting and retaining qualified teachers. Oftentimes students are not offered access to advanced coursework and information about college entrance requirements (Nettles, 2003, pp. 218-219).What students say/think about the Achievement Gap.The way students think and feel is important to consider. In order to close the achievement gap in math and science, we must first give students the confidence and the opportunities to succeed. Courses should be offered to prepare students for standardized tests, and the importance of these tests should be emphasized to minority and low income students. Parent’s help and involvement should be solicited as part of their child’s education. Schools should provide “Summer Bridge” learning opportunities and mentor programs to link student’s educational experiences to the world of work. Students should be provided with every possible resource and opportunity to help them achieve academic success (Hrabowski, 2003, pp. 44-48)Good teaching is extremely important and has been shown to impact the achievement of students. A study evaluated teachers through the eyes of students in an urban school setting. The students interviewed spoke of good teachers who held high expectations for them and held them to that high standard. The students stressed the importance of good teaching that results in learning. The students also spoke favorably of the block schedule claiming they learned better because the schedule forced teachers to become better at teaching. “Students simply wanted good teachers because such teachers made them learn - often in spite of themselves (Corbett, 2002, pp. 18-22).”Oftentimes, minority students are not aware of the perception their school and race achieves far below the standard. When the data was revealed to students in a Philadelphia inner-city school, the students gave the following primary responses as reasons for the lower scores: 31 percent indicated the students held themselves responsible, 24 percent referred to teacher behavior, 18 percent indicated their parents’ role, 13 percent discussed the schools themselves, and 11 percent referred to the students’ environment or community. They also included poverty and peer pressure in their responses. The students described teachers as unsupportive – “they just hand out the work and expect us to do it without doing much teaching.” The students wanted their parents to take a more active role in being involved in their education. The students wanted schools to hold them to higher expectations and provide curriculum that was challenging. Many of the students felt trapped in their home environment, and they felt that if they tried to improve their performance then they would be perceived as “acting white.” Communities and schools must come together, decide what they value for young people, and support that with all of their effort (Taylor, 2003, pp.72-75).Identifying the Causes for the Gap.Society and adults tend to claim the reasons for the achievement gap between races can be traced back to things outside of the school’s control, such as, lack of familial support, low socio-economic status, and lack of adequate basic needs (food, clothing, etc.). Students tend to communicate some different sources for the gap, such as, poorly prepared teachers, low expectations, and boring, non-challenging curriculum as biggerreasons for the achievement gap. The data seems to support what the students are saying. It shows that education takes the students who begin with less and systematically give them less in the schools. This does not diminish the role outside influences play in the education of students, but, rather, it says that what schools do matters greatly in the lives and education of these “disadvantaged” students (Haycock, 2001, p. 7-8).Research consistently reports a strong relationship between social class and performance on standardized tests such as the SAT. Many researchers have concluded one avenue through which socio-economic status affects achievement in high school is the academic courses the students take. Historically, high schools commonly placed students and organized their curricula by tracking, where students are placed in a set of courses based on their perceived educational ability. Although many high schools have replaced formal tracking with student choice as the means by which students are placed in courses, the relationship between students’ choice and their personal backgrounds resembles that found within traditional tracking curricula (Nettles, 2003, p.217).Teacher quality is an important issue affecting the achievement gap. As important as qualified teachers are, the amount of out-of-field teachers remains unacceptably high. In 1999-2000 school year, high poverty ad high minority schools had between 29 and 34 percent of core academic courses taught by out-of-field teachers. Poor and minority students are more than twice as likely to serve as a training ground for inexperienced or uncertified teachers as the average child (Jerald, 2002, pp. 1-9).Some Solutions for the Gap.The focus of education should be placed on the individual learner and on an understanding of the learning process. It should involve sensitivity to the diverse backgrounds of students and a certain level of connectedness between caring teachers and students. The focus should involve the breakdown of fragmented schools and evolve into collaborative efforts between teachers who are no longer isolated from one another. (McCombs, 2000, pp. 29-36).One school (Francis Bacon) narrowed the achievement gap by first focusing on behavior management and then researched strategies for raising academic achievement. The school concluded it is important to have high expectations for the students and to have a good vehicle for instruction to help the students meet those expectations. Collaboration between teachers is another important component in improving the achievement gap. “An isolated teacher can’t be successful. Teacher collaboration and teacher training are critical.” Another essential element is after school programs that help students to finish their homework. “When students get the right encouragement from a caring person, research shows, they can defy the odds (Quindlen, 2002, pp. 5-8).”Another important aspect in closing the achievement gap is comprehensive school reform. This includes an overall reorganization laying out high expectations and a specific plan of how the school will achieve those expectations. A high school in California went through this process with great success.  “The college board had justcome out with a report that showed a very high correlation between passing algebra and geometry in high school and later academic success.” So this school decided to make this a primary target in their reform process. Math became the backbone for the academic schedule for the students (Codding, 2000, pp. 79-92).The issue of minority student’s attitudes toward math and science achievement is important in reducing the achievement gap and promoting academic success amongst minority students. There is “a striking gap between students’ expectations regarding future careers and their understanding of the impact of current course decisions on these plans.” Minority students are less likely to attend schools offering advanced placement courses. These students are more likely to encounter negative peer pressure in their decisions to enroll in math and science courses. To succeed in advanced math courses, persistence is necessary, whereas, the basic math courses required for everyone can be passed by students who simply do the work. These courses are not enough to teach the persistence that is necessary for these students to become successful working in a math or science field. “A recent study ... showed that student attitudes toward mathematics are extremely important and play a large part in determining students’ motivation toward instruction and achievement.” Therefore, success in math courses and particularly advanced math courses is critical to the academic success of the student (Gilroy, 2002, pp. 39-44).Title 1, of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965, has had an effect on the achievement gap particularly in high poverty contexts. During the 1970’s and 1980’s the gap decreased by about two grade levels.  It is assumed that thisimprovement was in direct relation to the funding made available to counteract poverty, and, thus, continued funding is vital to continued improvement in the gap between white and black students. The importance of early childhood education and summer learning opportunities for children in poverty situations needs to continue to be an emphasis of this funding. Comprehensive school reform which focuses on reorganizing and revitalizing the entire school and reducing the student-teacher ratio is another important aspect of this funding (Borman, 2003, pp. 49-53).The Minority Student Achievement Network is a consortium of 15 school districts with high achievement levels but significant gaps in achievement between white students and their African-American or Latino peers. They have banded together to examine and evaluate data in an effort to emphasize the achievement of students of color. “The Network agrees wholeheartedly that the causes of the achievement gap are neither differences in innate ability nor the result of biased test questions (Kober, 2001),” and the gap is both complex and systemic. The group is concerned with the fact that the Black and Latino students with college educated parents scored lower on a 12th grade reading test than their white peers whose parents only had a high school diploma. They assert that socioeconomic factors account for only part of the achievement gap. The network members agree there are many factors that influence in varying degrees the gap including (but not limited to) racism, poverty, poor educational leadership, low teacher’ expectations, negative peer pressure, etc. (Alson, 2003, pp. 76-78).Comprehensive School ReformThe dominant strategy for school reform has historically consisted of systemic changes to things like standards, assessments, accountability, governance (vouchers and charters), and funding plans. These systemic reforms are policies government at the federal, state, or local levels can prescribe to large numbers of schools. These reforms have little direct influence on the methods and materials used within the classroom to ensure success. Comprehensive school reform shares the goal of systemic school reform – improved student achievement on a broad scale. The difference is comprehensive school reform begins by considering the school as the unit of reform. Ultimately, comprehensive school reform intends to affect every aspect of school functioning. The different models vary considerably, but they all aim to affect curriculum, instruction, assessment, school organization, necessary support for students having difficulties, parental involvement, and sustained professional development for the staff. Because this reform begins at the school level, staff buy-in is critical to establish prior to implementing the reform (Slavin, 2001, pp 22-23).If a large high school with a high poverty student population has major problems of absenteeism, low test scores, and high drop-out rates, the only solution is a powerful comprehensive school reform which can turn the school around and keep it strong. A comprehensive package of changes establishing new structures and conditions which promote positive human relationships and effective learning opportunities is needed in large, high poverty high schools (Jordan, 2000, pp.159-160).The first requirement of reform is to create a school environment which is conducive to learning and to improve student attendance. The school authority must be clearly and visibly in charge of discipline, and they must convey the message that this is a “real school” in which high academic achievement is expected from all students. The reforms must promote conditions where respectful and caring relationships can be developed between teachers and students. Discipline problems should fade so that administrators can rule without resentment. A high priority must be placed on student attendance so that there is the opportunity to increase learning (Jordan, 2000, p. 161).High schools that are large and departmentalized are often cited as a contributing factor to a climate where discipline is weak and students feel estranged from the school. The teacher to student ratio is so large students who misbehave can become anonymous and escape the regular, effective control of the school (Lee, 1995, pp. 243-245).Curriculum and instruction must be addressed in comprehensive school reform. The curriculum in large, high-poverty schools is too often unchallenging and uninteresting. Usually, low-level and watered-down courses are offered to everyone except the advanced, college-bound students (Jordan, 2000, p.162). These course offerings continue even though there is a consensus that most students will benefit from a core curriculum with high standards which contains demanding material (Lucas, 1999). Classroom instruction continues to consist of teacher-led lectures and individual worksheets which emphasize drill and practice of isolated facts and formulas.  Absentfrom instruction are student learning activities which incorporate cooperative learning and project-based instruction that encourage a deeper understanding of the content and practical applications (Darling-Hammond, 1997).If staff are expected and encouraged to use new curriculum and try new instructional methodology, they need to receive high-level professional training and direct assistance with their classes. Currently, most secondary teachers teach and learn alone. Professional development and training is a necessary component to successful comprehensive school reform (Jordan, 2000, pp. 162-163).Talent Development ModelOne model of comprehensive school reform, called the Talent Development Model, was designed to address the problem of large, urban, nonselective high schools. It was researched and developed at Johns Hopkins University and implemented in Patterson High School in Baltimore. This school was chosen for the reforms because it represented one of the poorest educational environments in the state of Maryland (Jordan, 2000, p. 164).The Talent Development Model contains two organizational reform components. The first is the Academy structure which reduces student apathy and anonymity by creating smaller, more personalized learning communities. The upper grades choose a career focus for their curriculum. The second component is the Twilight School whichprovides recovery opportunities for students with serious discipline problems (Jordan, 2000, p. 165).Career Academy ProgramsHigh school career academies were originally designed to address the needs of at risk students. One of the suggested reasons that at risk students do not achieve in school is they feel school is irrelevant to the real world. Career academies bridge the world of academia and the real world of work. A career academy is a type of comprehensive school reform that has several defining characteristics. The academy is a “school-within- a-school” in the high school grades run by a small team of teachers from various disciplines. The academy recruits students who volunteer for the program and demonstrate their commitment through an application process. The career academy focuses on a theme in a field in which demand is growing and good employment opportunities exist in the local labor market. The curriculum combines technical and academic courses each semester. The academy includes general employment skills while keeping the option of attending college open to all of its students. The academy provides opportunities for students to be employed part-time during the school year and full-time during vacation times in the field of their academy. The career academy involves representatives from the field of employment to help plan and guide the program. These representatives are involved as speakers, field trip hosts, job supervisors, and mentors for individual students. The academy contributes to the students’ sense of membership in acaring school community through smaller class sizes than a typical high school, a system of motivation and rewards, and regular contact with their parents. The career academy has the capability of utilizing funds from a variety of community, government, and business sources. A successful career academy is designed with these characteristics as a guide (Stern, 1992).Each academy is self-contained. They are each led by an administrative team consisting of an academy principal (usually an assistant principal) and an academy instructional leader (usually the department chair of the subject most closely associated with the academy). There is one guidance counselor per academy. To further solidify their unique identities, academies may select banners and mottoes to decorate hallways and staircases (Jordan, 2000, p. 166).As with any reform movement, several obstacles will exist that must be overcome. Career academies are no exception to this rule. Guidelines for control over the necessary funds to run a successful career academy must be established between the school district, funding agencies, and the staff who implement the program. Apathy amongst the staff must be overcome or avoided in order for a fully functional academy to run effectively. This must be considered as staff are chosen or hired who will be involved in the academy. Union contract guidelines must also be considered in this process. Full administrative support is a critical component in a career academy. These are some of the obstacles that must be considered and overcome when implementing a career academy into a high school (Shorr, 1999, pp. 381-382).Collaboration amongst the staff is an important element in a functioning career academy. Common planning times amongst all the staff in the academy are necessary so that weekly meetings can be held to facilitate this collaboration. During this meeting time, the bond between staff can be strengthened while instructional, motivational, and cooperative strategies can be planned (Shorr, 1999, p. 383)Professional development and training for the staff is another key component for the career academies. Training is necessary in order for teachers to learn to collaborate and educate in a cooperative manner. Special training is also necessary for teachers to learn to integrate the technology required by the academy focus into the curricula for each of their classes (Shorr, 1999, p. 383).Industry and community partnerships play an important role in a successful career academy. Representatives from the industry by which the academy is focused participate as important partners in all aspects of the career academy. Members of the community also can help staff members make additional connections with other potential industry participants who did not originally share the enthusiasm for becoming involved with high school students who are considered at risk (Shorr, 1999, pp. 383-384).In career academies, curriculum is developed combining learning outcomes from several disciplines with the advantages of team teaching and computer technologies. The curriculum should be designed thematically to incorporate the technology and principlesof the career field the academy is based upon. Using technology, teachers can design projects based on the tenets of the career academy by utilizing components of the career academy such as special speakers, field trips, mentors, internships, and parents. Classes are blocked into adjacent time periods to allow for plenty of time to accomplish the tasks and activities associated with a major project. The projects are designed in such a way that they lead up to a culminating senior project that incorporates all that they have learned through their years in the career academy. This senior project would be a large part of a portfolio the students would compile to present to a future employer demonstrating the skills and knowledge they have acquired through participation in the career academy (Shorr, 1999, pp.384-386).Students follow a block schedule for their classes throughout the day. Students move together from class to class. The block typically consumes either the entire morning or afternoon, and the academy teachers decide on how to divide up the time. Block scheduling allows for more flexibility in class length permitting classes to be longer or shorter, as necessary.Extra help is available through a variety of avenues in the career academy. Students who obtain a grade lower than a C must participate in tutoring sessions occurring before or after school until their grade rises to a C or better. The tutoring is also available to all of the students on a voluntary basis. Community volunteers, parents, and retired citizens are recruited to work as tutors for the students (Shorr, 1999, p. 386).A mentoring program in which industry, community, and business people are paired up one on one with a high school student is a part of the career academy model. The mentor works with the student and provides guidance, instruction, and an example of how to use education to become successful in life. A study at Colombia University investigated the lives of 100 prominent Americans and found that those who came from a disadvantaged background were especially likely to cite the influence of a mentor as a key to their success (Rutherford, 1998, pp.78-86). A major goal of the mentoring program is to introduce the students to the world of work as many of them come from poor urban or immigrant families (Shorr, 1999, p.386).The internship program is a vital link in the career academy between the school training and the labor market. Students are exposed to the world of work and to a variety of opportunities that exist in the field they have chosen. The combination of practical experience and educational training provides motivation to the students and ensures that they receive training that is compatible with the local labor market. Internships usually begin as unpaid experiences, but often lead to paid opportunities (Shorr, 1999, p.388).Twilight SchoolThe other organizational component of the Talent Development Model is the Twilight School. This is an after-hours, on-site, short-term alternative program for a small group of students who have serious discipline and attendance issues. Twilight School meets for three hours each day after the regular program is dismissed.  Thesmaller classes are for those students who are coming from juvenile justice institutions and court referrals, or for those who have regular confrontations with teachers or other students disturbing the learning environment for the rest of the class. These classes are taught by regular day school faculty who are working on overtime. Students in Twilight School take three academic courses which are the same as day school courses so that they can return to day school any time they are ready (Jordan, 2000, p. 170).Outcomes of Career AcademiesSchools that have implemented career academies have reported positive results. Hollywood High School, in Hollywood, CA, (78 percent minority population and 85 percent free or reduced lunch population) gives testimony to improved results in several key areas. There was an 83 percent graduation rate for those students who completed the academy program compared to 35 percent that were not in the program. The senior project generated enough enthusiasm that 100 percent of participating students completed the project satisfactorily. More than 65 percent of the students received scholarships to 2- and 4-year colleges and universities (Shorr, 1999, pp. 388-389).In other studies of career academies, similar positive results were reported. Attendance rates increased by between 10 and 20 percentage points which probably accounts for the improvement in grades and graduation rates (Elliott, 2002, p. 88).Possible Reasons Why Career Academies Promote Higher AchievementOne of the more obvious reasons career academies seem to be effective is the identifiable core of teachers and students that belong to the academy. Teachers identify themselves with the academy, regardless of whether they have classes containing only academy students. These teachers know who the academy students are, share information about these students, and intensively tracks these students’ behavior and absences – even more so than for other non-academy students (Hanser, 2000, p.33).Even more important than the teachers who identify themselves with the academy, the students identify themselves as being a part of a special program. Students express their feelings toward the academy as a tight-knit, family unit. Students are aware of the fact that the teachers share information about them and monitor their progress and development. Students notice the increased attention they receive both inside and outside of the classroom. They recognize more positive communication between their teachers and parents. While the vocational opportunities afforded to the students through the career academies may motivate students, research indicates that the nurturing environment offered to students in this atmosphere is the major factor in improving achievement (Elliott, 2002, pp. 88-89).Chapter 3: The Effectiveness of Career AcademiesIntroductionOver the past twenty years, there has been extensive research on education reform focusing on the achievement gap between white and minority students. East High School in Columbus, Ohio, an inner-city school whose demographics are 97 percent African- American, has implemented a possible solution to improve student achievement within the school and to narrow the achievement gap between African-American and White students. The program, which has been implemented into four low performing high schools in Columbus, is called Columbus Pathways to Success Initiative. This program is based on research-based model called the Talent Development model out of Johns Hopkins University. The comprehensive reform model was implemented at East High School and was structured by High Schools That Work, a non-profit comprehensive school reform organization that is funded by grant money.Columbus Pathways to Success Initiative (CPSI)CPSI is a high school reform model developed in 1999 based on High-Schools- That-Work and other nationally recognized reform models. This initiative is a collaborative effort between the Columbus Public Schools, the Columbus Chamber of Commerce, Columbus Education Association, Columbus State Community College, and other post secondary institutions.  It was initiated by the Chamber of Commerce as aneffort to develop the future workforce within Columbus instead of drawing people from other places. The rationale for the school system is to improve the student retention rate and to improve student achievement. There are several components within the CPSI which include the following: Freshman Success Academy, Acceleration Academy, a summer bridge program, career academies, teacher advisement program, staff development, public relations, data collection, analysis, and recommendations.High-Schools-That-WorkThere are several key practices that are adopted by schools that follow this model of school reform. High-Schools-That-Work (HSTW) is a comprehensive reform grant that works with the school and provides funding to implement these practices. It provides professional development for staff and funding for extra positions and programs necessary for this reform to be successful.There are three goals of HSTW. The first goal is to increase achievement in mathematics, science, communication, problem-solving, and technical skills. Another goal is to blend the content of traditional college preparatory courses with quality vocational and technical studies. The third goal is to advance policies and leadership initiatives necessary to sustain a continuous school-improvement effort.At the high school level, HSTW advocates ten key practices essential for reform to be successful in increasing student achievement. The first key practice is setting highexpectations and getting more and more students to meet them. Incorporating vocational studies into the regular curriculum is another key practice. The emphasis in these studies is using high level mathematics, science, language arts, and problem solving skills in the modern workplace. The academic studies should increase student access to academics that teach the essential concepts from the college preparatory curriculum by incorporating real-world problems and projects into the lessons. The program of study should be challenging with an upgraded academic core and a major emphasis. The course of study will give students and parents a system integrating school-based and work-based learning. The learning would span across high school and post-secondary studies. The fifth key practice involves teachers working together. Organization, structure, and scheduling should give academic and vocational teachers the time to plan and deliver integrated instruction aimed at teaching high-level content. Another key practice is getting students actively engaged in rigorous and challenging learning. Each student and his/her parent should receive guidance and advisement ensuring the completion of an accelerated program of study. The ninth key practice is to provide a structured system of extra help to enable students with inadequate preparation to complete a high-level program of study. The last key practice advocated by HSTW is to use student assessment and evaluation data to continuously improve school climate, organization, management, curriculum, and instruction. The purpose of this data analysis is to promote student learning and to recognize students who meet performance goals. When these practices are adhered to, reform is successful, student achievement is increased, and the school improves continuously.The Talent Development ModelThe Talent Development Model was formulated at Johns Hopkins University and implemented into a few high schools in Baltimore, Maryland. This model incorporates several components which were adapted and used at East High School. The two major components originating in the Talent Development Model used at East High School were the career academies (curriculum with a focus on future career skills) and twilight school (an after-school program for students who are unable to successfully function in a traditional classroom).Academic EmergencyAs part of the federal government’s education reform initiative, No Child Left Behind, schools that meet a certain number of criteria are labeled into different categories. Columbus Public Schools and East High School was in the lowest category, academic emergency. During the summer following the 2002-2003 school year, Columbus Public Schools were moved out of the academic emergency and into the academic watch category on the state report card.Career AcademiesThe model chosen for continuous improvement was career academies. The model organizes large schools into smaller learning communities called “schools within aschool” or academies. Freshman entering the school are part of the Freshman Success Academy which will be explained in great detail later in the research. Upon successful completion of the freshman year, students are required to select a career academy based on their future interests. The students have four possibilities to choose from which include the following career academies: Health Sciences, Arts and Communications, ACE (Architecture, Construction, and Engineering), and TEAM (Technology, Engineering, and Manufacturing). The students are then organized by academy into smaller groups who travel together between classes and have the same team of teachers in their core-academic classes for three years. The classes are all centered on the theme of their career academy, and the students have opportunities at earning college credit, experiencing valuable internships, gaining important know-how, and learning from a mentor from the business community. Students in the career academies will have the opportunity to earn for free up to 45 college credits and will leave high school with the promise of a job. The career academy gives focus and purpose to the high school academic experience.Architecture, Construction, and Engineering Academy (ACE)The ACE academy focuses primarily on the building trades. As sophomores, the students take typical college preparatory courses in addition to electives centered on the trades including an introductory foundation class for the academy. The students have theopportunity to take classes to learn such skills as Auto-CAD, mechanical drawing, and basic construction skills.After their sophomore year, students have three options within the ACE Academy. They may choose from one of the following: architectural/civil technology, mechanical technology, or structural technology. Then, during their junior and senior years, the students continue to take their college preparatory classes at East, but they spend half of their time at a vocational career center receiving hands-on training in a specific trade. The core academic classes have incorporated into them projects and an emphasis centered on the construction trades. Students have the opportunity to volunteer their time to work on building projects outside of the school setting through Habitat for Humanity and other non-profit organizations. The academy has several business partners in the community that provide opportunities for professional development, field trips, and special speakers. These business partners also provide internship opportunities and mentors for the students. During the summer between their junior and senior years, the students are involved in an internship with a business partner and are enrolled in college classes where they can earn college credit. Students would choose this academy if they had an interest in the construction trades, architecture, or engineering.Upon graduation, having come through the ACE Academy, the students would be ready to enter a post-secondary institution in any of the following programs: architecture, civil engineering technology, construction management, heating, ventilation, and air- conditioning technology. If their goals do not include further education, they would beadequately prepared for the work force. Their previous work experience would be such that they would qualify for many jobs requiring such previous experience. Students also have had many opportunities to meet and network with people in the industry. The ACE Academy is sponsored by the Columbus Chamber of Commerce.Arts and Communication AcademyThe Arts and Communication (A&C) Academy is for those students who are artistically inclined and would enjoy creating, performing, or writing. The students in this academy would follow a similar college preparatory schedule during their freshman (FSA) and sophomore year as the students in the ACE Academy. Their schedule would include Career Connections during their freshman year and a Foundations course during their sophomore year.At the end of their sophomore year, students have the opportunity to choose from three different courses of study to follow during their junior and senior years. The first career path is in Communications Media where they would study multimedia, computer graphics, creative writing, and publication. The second career path is the Performing Arts. Students would study music, theatre, and dance (if available). The third career path is the Visual Arts in which students would study art, photography, and design. Students in the A&C Academy, during their summers, have the opportunity to take college classes and take part in an internship.Health Sciences AcademyStudents in the Health Sciences Academy have an interest in a career in the health industry. They have strong science aptitude and a desire to work with and help other people. Their course of study will follow a similar route as the other academies during their freshman (FSA) and sophomore years. These students follow a rigorous science and math curriculum.At the end of their sophomore year, students in the Health Sciences Academy have two career paths to choose from in which their course of study during their junior and senior years will follow. The first career path is the Medical Services which would lead to further education and jobs in nursing, lab technicians, EMS, or pharmacy. The second career path students may choose from is Sports and Fitness Management. This path would lead to further education and jobs in sports and fitness management, or athletic training. Students in the Health Sciences Academy also have the opportunity to earn college credit and take part in internships during their summers. The Health Sciences Academy is sponsored by the Columbus Chamber of Commerce.Technology, Engineering, and Manufacturing Academy (TEAM)The Technology, Engineering, and Manufacturing (TEAM) Academy is for students who want to receive training and education preparing them for careers in designing new products and in the assembly of the products. Again, students follow a similar course of study during their freshman (FSA) and sophomore years as students in the other academies. Students should have strong aptitude in mathematics and computer science. They should enjoy working with their hands, understanding how things work, and designing things.As with the other academies, students can choose from three different career paths at the end of their sophomore year. The first career path is Electronic Engineering Technology in which students will learn the basics in electrical technology. This path would prepare students to work in the field of electronics or electrical technology. The second career path is Computer Aided Design Technology which would train the students in mechanical drafting, computer aided drafting (CAD), and basic manufacturing and mechanical principles. The third career path is Mechanical Engineering Technology which is similar to the other two paths with the addition of Machining, Hydraulics, and Robotics. The students in the TEAM Academy also have the opportunities to earn college credit, take part in summer internships, and have the promise of a job upon high school graduation. The TEAM Academy is sponsored by the Columbus Chamber of Commerce.The Freshman Success AcademyThe research will focus on the Freshman Success Academy (FSA). The FSA is a self-contained school-within-a-school organized around interdisciplinary teams of teachers designed to provide incoming freshman a smooth transition to high school. The rationale for the FSA is to improve student attendance, improve academic success, reduce the drop out rate, and instruction focused on career education. There are many components that are incorporated into a successful FSA.Teacher Buy-inIn order for the FSA to be successful, teachers must buy in to the collaborative effort. Teachers must be willing to work as a team to accomplish common goals. Oftentimes, teachers in the academy setting will be required to go above and beyond the contractual expectations of a teacher. General hiring and interview practices ensure that new members of the team do buy-in, but it is crucial for current staff members to cooperate with the team concept.Lead TeachersThe lead teacher of the academy plays an important role in the success of the academy. They communicate regularly with both school administration and district administration in order to ensure the academy is functioning and achieving itsexpectations. The lead teacher accomplishes this by attending all scheduled district-wide and school lead teacher/administrator meetings.The lead teacher of the academy provides necessary leadership within the academy. They clarify team goals and priorities. They facilitate the collection and team analysis of data. The lead teachers plan agendas, coordinate team meetings and documentation of activities. They coordinate all team activities and staff development for team members.Teacher CollaborationCollaboration amongst the team of teachers is a key part in the FSA. The team of teachers involved in the FSA work together very closely in standardizing the experience of the students in all of their classes. In order to facilitate this collaboration, the teachers share a common planning time in which they meet at least twice a week to coordinate their plans (Appendix C). The teachers have a common syllabus (Appendix A) that outlines common expectations, a common grading scale, the teaching philosophies and objectives of each course. There are ten core values that are posted in a visible and creative way in each classroom. These values are emphasized, taught, and adhered to in every classroom as what the behavioral expectations are. Several times throughout the school year the teachers map and integrate their curriculum. They plan cross-curricular projects and activities so that the students receive different academic perspectives on the same project or learning unit.Small Learning CommunitiesThe FSA is organized into small learning communities, called teams, in which students travel in groups to the same classes with the same team of teachers. The academy has a designated location within the building so the students spend the majority of the day in the same section of the school. The FSA is located primarily in the basement of the high school.Career ConnectionsEvery freshman within the academy takes an elective course called Career Connections. This course offers the students an overview of possible careers as well as different career development activities. The course is an introduction to the career focused education that is a key component in the academy model.Communication with ParentsCommunication with the parents is emphasized within the FSA. To open up this communication, teachers participate in home visits during the summer prior to the school year. During these visits, teachers share the student’s schedules, discuss values and expectations, and show a promotional video showcasing the FSA. The visits are effective in conveying the educational opportunity available to the student as well as openingcommunication between teachers and the parents. Throughout the school year, parents will receive a personal phone call twice a month from a teacher in the team (Appendix D). A record of these phone calls is kept in a phone log which records what was discussed in each conversation (Appendix J). At the beginning of the year, the parents are invited via phone to an Open House in which the parents are introduced to the entire staff, reminded of expectations, and served refreshments.The Importance of Academic AchievementThe curriculum of the FSA is college preparatory. One of the purposes of the FSA is to improve academic achievement of the students. There are several procedures in place to assist in accomplishing this purpose. First, there is a weekly grade check for the students where each teacher communicates the current grade the student has in that class. This occurs Monday or Tuesday of every week, and its purpose is for the students to have current and regular feedback in each of their classes. In order to regularly evaluate the progress of the freshman class as a whole, data is collected and evaluated on a weekly basis (Appendix E and F). The data includes attendance, parental contact, discipline, and the number of students with A’s or B’s and F’s. At the end of the first semester, students are called in with their parents for a conference with the team of teachers to review a credit check sheet. The credit check sheet (Appendix B) is a paper with all of the core courses and electives listed as well as the grades and credits earned by that student for the first semester. The teachers use this opportunity to explain the progress of the student so far, communicate areas of weakness where the student mayhave fallen behind, and remind them of the importance of being successful in all of their classes as a freshman. For instances where there are persistent behavioral, academic, or social problems, the team calls an intervention meeting. The parent’s attendance is requested by phone, and then teachers and oftentimes the social worker meet with the student. Strengths of the student are shared and discussed first, followed by a discussion of the problem(s) that persist. The student is given an opportunity to share any concerns that he/she might have, and then a plan is laid out to correct the current problem (Appendix K). A follow-up meeting is scheduled to discuss progress or the lack thereof in the specified area.Another important piece in the FSA regarding academic achievement is the free extra help that is available to all students. Math classes are double blocked throughout the year to make certain that all students receive the necessary instruction to catch them up if necessary and to ensure success in their future high school math courses. There also are available Career Based Intervention (math assistance) classes for those who come into high school lacking the basic math skills necessary to be successful in high school math. Also available to the students is after school tutoring in all of their core academic courses. Students may go as often as they need and stay as long as they need to guarantee that they understand and remain caught up in their studies.Attendance PolicyAttendance is a priority in the FSA. In order for students to achieve academically, they must be in school on a regular basis. This priority is emphasized in each of the core academic courses by making attendance a significant part of the grade received. The students receive ten points each day for being in class on time which accounts for 15 -20 percent of the overall grade in each class.Small Class SizeA priority of the FSA is to maintain small class sizes to ensure good individual attention for all of the students. The teacher to student ratio is 1:25 or smaller. This is also part of the smaller learning communities.Acceleration AcademyAcceleration Academy is an important piece of the reform model affecting student achievement. Acceleration Academy is an after hours “safety net” program designed to help students who have a difficult time adjusting to high school. Students can be assigned, with parental approval, to the Acceleration Academy if they strugglewith attendance, behavior, or academics in the traditional daytime high school classroom. The classes meet from 2:00 pm until 6:00 pm every day.The rationale for the Acceleration Academy is to reduce the number of distractions for the other students in the day program, and to provide the necessary skills for these students to be successful in the day program. This program provides an alternative environment with more extensive support services in order to increase opportunities for student achievement. As students experience success in this environment, the drop out rate is reduced.There are many components that make the Acceleration Academy unique and successful. Students will receive instruction in math, reading/language arts, and study skills. There is also tutoring for the Ohio Ninth Grade Proficiency Tests. The student to teacher ratio is no more than 1:15. Students are assigned for a mandatory minimum of one semester in which they can earn credits, and, if they are successful, they may return to the day program. Since the academy meets after school, transportation is provided to students who need it. If students return to the day program, they are monitored and mentored to ensure a successful return. It is possible for students to make up credits they have previously lost.Summer BridgeSummer Bridge is another “safety net” program designed to provide reading, math, and study skills to incoming freshman. The rationale for the program is to improve math and reading skills, improve study skills for the rigor of high school, and introduce students to post-secondary education and career opportunities.There are several important components that make up the Summer Bridge program. Math and reading acceleration are components that help to ensure future success in high school with these vital skills. Study skill techniques are also taught during Summer Bridge. Students receive extra opportunities to take the proficiency test if they attend this program. Students can attend at no cost to them or their parents, and they receive free transportation and free breakfast.Ohio Ninth Grade Proficiency TestsThe State of Ohio administers a ninth grade proficiency test in the areas of Reading, Writing, Citizenship, Mathematics, and Science. Students are required to pass all five parts of the proficiency test in order to graduate from high school. These tests are a priority within the FSA. The thinking is that if a freshman has passed all or most of the tests as a freshman then their probability of successfully graduating from high school increases dramatically. Therefore, a good amount of time is devoted to preparing the students for these proficiency tests. In the math classes, the math teachers organize thestudents based on whether or not they have passed the math proficiency test. The students that have not passed the test remain in the classroom and receive extensive instruction and preparation for the test. The students who have already passed the test (and do not have to take the test again) go to work on a hands-on project that is an extension of the classroom curriculum. These students have the opportunity to work on projects that the regular classroom and routine would not be able to facilitate like building balsa-wood bridges and working with graphing calculators. This makes it possible for the students who need the extra instruction in order to pass the proficiency test get it without boring the students who have already passed.Rewards and MotivationAnother important piece in the FSA is motivating students on to success and then recognizing them for success. There are many different ways in which students are motivated and rewarded for doing the right thing academically and behaviorally. In each class, teachers have tickets to give to students for doing something good (Appendix G). This may be something as simple as answering a difficult problem correctly, a random act of kindness, or doing an assigned task well. These tickets are stored in a ticket bin, and each week the teachers draw five names out of the bin. The students whose names were drawn receive the opportunity to choose a prize out of the prize drawer which is stocked with an assortment of prizes such as candy, candles, school supplies, make-up, school spirit items, etc. The teachers are responsible for keeping the prize drawer well stocked. All of the tickets not drawn that week then go into a separate bin that will bedrawn from at the award assemblies for much larger prizes such as sweatshirts, DVD players, boom boxes, etc.Awards AssembliesFour times per year, after each nine week grading period, award assemblies are held to honor student achievement (Appendix H). Once again, parents are invited over the phone to attend and see their child receive an award. At the assembly, awards are handed out recognizing achievement in the following categories: perfect attendance, outstanding scholar (honor roll), most improved student, outstanding student (exceptional academic and behavioral performance), and 110 percent (hardest worker award). Many students may receive a certificate for performance in each category, but then one student is voted as the overall winner in that category by the teachers. The winner receives a certificate, a reward (usually a sweatshirt, purse, or something similar), their picture on the school web-site, and their name on a plaque displayed in a trophy case in the hallway at school. Any student that earns a 4.0 (straight A’s in all subject areas) receives a t-shirt with their certificate. Throughout the award assembly, names are drawn from the ticket bin for various prizes. The last assembly of the year is a picnic at a park near the school. These assemblies are a celebration of student accomplishment that is enjoyed by parents and students alike.Honor Roll StudentsThere are special opportunities for students who make the honor roll for a nine- week grading period. First, they receive a certificate and recognition at the awards assembly (Appendix I). Secondly, a church in the surrounding neighborhood sponsors a free breakfast for the honor roll students in which they invite special speakers who are both community leaders and East High Alumni. Finally, they receive the opportunity to participate in the Honor Roll Sponsorship Program. This program allows each of the honor roll students to choose a fellow student who did not make the honor roll with whom to partner. If the honor roll student maintains his/her honor roll status while pulling their partner up onto the honor roll, then both students receives a free t-shirt and a pizza party. This program provides motivation for the students to stay on honor roll while helping a fellow student to achieve this status. Honor roll is a significant achievement, and it should be duly recognized and aspired to.Hand PrintsSuccess on the Ohio Ninth Grade Proficiency Test is a very important aspect in determining the success of the FSA. Therefore, when students achieve in this area by passing each part of the proficiency test, they are afforded the opportunity to be recognized for many years to come. For each area of the proficiency test in which the student passes, they place their handprint on the wall of the classroom that corresponds tothe section that they passed (for example, if they passed the math section, then they would place their handprint on the wall in their math classroom). The handprints will remain on the wall for all to see indefinitely.Cleveland TripTowards the end of the year, the entire FSA will be rewarded for their efforts with an all day trip to Cleveland. The staff and students travel to and from Cleveland in luxury charter buses. In Cleveland, they spend the morning touring a historical cemetery and an African-American museum. Then they board a luxury boat for a lunch cruise out onto Lake Erie. On the boat, the staff and students are treated to an all-you-can-eat buffet, music, and a DJ. There are academic assignments aligned with the trip, but it is primarily a reward for a great school year.Team T-ShirtsAs a way of building team pride within the FSA, each year team t-shirts are designed. Everyone (staff and students) are required to purchase one to wear to all of the award assemblies and the Cleveland trip. The t-shirts can be purchased in orange or black (school colors) and have “Property of East High” on the front and the motivational slogan for the year on back.Pilgrim MentoringMentoring programs are another opportunity promoting success in the lives of students. In the career academy, the students will receive mentoring from a business person, but in the FSA the students are required to become a mentor to an elementary age child who struggles with academics. Pilgrim Elementary School is a feeder school for East High School. The elementary school is in academic emergency. The FSA has instituted a mentoring program in which the ninth graders are paired up with a child in the first through sixth grade who is need of help. Each Monday afternoon, after school, the ninth graders walk down to Pilgrim Elementary School to spend 45 minutes working with a child who is assigned to them for the year. During this time, the child must spend twenty minutes reading out loud and writing sentences based on what they have read. The ninth graders then work with the children on any other school work their child needs to finish. The students have established many strong relationships with their child and are hopefully increasing their chance of success in the classroom. The freshman do receive community service hours in return which they need for graduation.The Research ProcessWhile there are several factors that may contribute to the achievement gap such as socio-economic status, lack of family/community support, poor school conditions, etc., the researcher will focus on the differences between the racial disparities. The researcherwill explain the overall program that has been implemented and analyze the results by making two separate comparisons. The comparisons will evaluate data that was gathered during two different academic years, 2000-01 (pre-academy) and 2002-2003 (fully- functional academy). The researcher will analyze data from these years to compare the results within the school to evaluate the academy’s effectiveness within the school as well as to compare the results with the white population within the State of Ohio to evaluate the academy’s effectiveness in narrowing the achievement gap between White and African-American students.Results within the SchoolThere are several important statistics that are analyzed to evaluate the success of the academy. The first data set that is evaluated is the attendance rate. During the 2000- 01 school year, the attendance rate for the freshman class was 73 percent, and, during the 2002-03 school year, the attendance rate increased to 86 percent.Results on the Ohio 9th Grade Proficiency Test improved in every subject area significantly between the 2000-01 and 2002-03 school years. There was continuous and consistent improvement in the rate of students who passed in all five sections of the proficiency test. The following chart demonstrates the progress of passing rates as the academy model was implemented into the school.Ohio 9th Grade Proficiency Test ScoresThese results represent students who were first year freshman at East High School during that school year. There is consistent improvement in all areas of the proficiency test after the implementation of the academy model.The failure rates decreased in all of the core academic subject areas during these same school years as the following chart demonstrates. The percentages represent the number of students taking the course that earned a failing grade and, therefore did not receive credit for this required course.Failure RatesThe decreasing number of failures, combined with the improved attendance rate and improved success on the proficiency tests, were a large factor in improving the matriculation rate. The matriculation rate for the Freshman Success Academy is defined as the number of students who received enough credits to make them legitimate sophomores at the end of their freshman year. The matriculation rate for East High School freshman improved from 52 percent at the end of the 2001-02 school year to 68 percent at the end of the 2002-03 school year.There were some other statistics that were indicative of the large number of students who succeeded in the F.S.A. atmosphere. There were 180 freshman enrolled in the F.S.A. Of those students, an average of 7 percent earned a 4.0 G.P.A. (straight A’s) each of the nine-week grading periods. An average of 15 percent earned at least a 3.5G.P.A. each nine-week grading period.  An average of 44 percent earned at least a 3.0each nine-week grading period which placed them on the school’s honor roll.\tThese numbers indicate that a large number of students thrived while enrolled in the F.S.A.Statistics Comparing East High School with the State of Ohio Disaggregated by RaceThe following statistics were generated through the Ohio Department of Education website. The website makes available data and a statistic-generating program called Microstrategy. This program contains data from the State of Ohio, Ohio’s schools, and school districts, and it allows generation of comparative statistics. The address for the website is www.ilrc.ode.state.oh.us/Microstrategy.Attendance Rates Results Disaggregated by RaceAttendance Rate – Building and District*East High School’s racial composition is almost 100% BlackAttendance Rate – State of OhioThe achievement gap is not obviously reflected in the attendance rates at the district and state level. There is a noticeable gap between students who attend East High School (almost exclusively African-American) and all the other White students in the State of Ohio. There is a significant decrease in this achievement gap during the time between the 2000-01 and the 2002-03 school years. The gap decreased from 16 percent during the 2000-01 school year to 7.9 percent during the 2002-03 school year. The increase in attendance at East High School may partially account for the increased academic achievement.Proficiency Results Disaggregated by RaceThe following chart shows the results of all five parts of the Ohio Ninth Grade Proficiency Tests for 2000-01 and 2002-03. It compares the freshman students attendingEast High School (comprised of almost all African-Americans) with both the Black and White students across the State of Ohio.The results indicate that gains were made over these years in decreasing the achievement gap between White and African-American students. As previously stated, the academy structure significantly improved the results in every area within the school. The results also indicate that the school made more progress in each area when compared to the other Black students in the State of Ohio. In fact, East High freshman had considerably more students pass each area of the proficiency test in 2002-03 except for the science section in 2002-03 than did all of the other Black students across the State of Ohio.It is necessary to examine the effect the academy structure at East High School had on the achievement gap between African-American and White students. The achievement gap decreased in every subject area of the Ohio Ninth Grade Proficiency Test. In fact, in the writing section the African-American students at East High School surpassed the number of White students passing this portion of the test. In Reading, the gap decreased from 25 percent in 2000-01 to 11 percent in 2002-03. In the Math section, the achievement gap lessened from 44 percent in 2000-01 to 24 percent in 2002-03. In the Citizenship portion of the test, the gap was decreased by half when it went from 32 percent in 2000-01 to 16 percent in 2002-03. Finally, in the science section, the gap, while it remains very large, did decrease from 48 percent in 2000-01 to 35 percent in 2002-03. The achievement gap between Black and White students was reduced, and in one section eliminated, in all areas of the Ohio Ninth Grade Proficiency Test at East High School.Significance of the ResultsThese results were significant in demonstrating the effectiveness of the academy structure in reducing the achievement gap between African-American and White students. The major change that occurred at East High School between the two years being compared was the implementation and the functionality of the Freshman Success Academy.Chapter 4: Perspectives, Conclusions, and RecommendationsThere are five different groups of people affected by the academy model: the teachers, the school administrators, the parents, the students, and the researchers. Perspectives and conclusions from each group will be disclosed.Perspectives and Conclusions of the TeachersThe Teacher Questionnaire (Appendix L) was given to seven public school teachers who were directly involved with the Freshman Success Academy at East High School. The teachers who shared their responses have been teaching for the following number of years: 30, 1, 1, 6, 15, 32, and 7. There were two teachers that indicated they have 6 years experience in an academy setting, and the rest had 3 years experience in the academy structure. Their responses will be shared.Question: “What are the positive aspects, if any, of teaching in an academy?”The teacher all related how the community of teachers with shared expectations and students allows cross-referencing and cohesiveness with one another. It allows teachers to be unified in dealing with achievement and discipline issues. The common planning time is important to allow time to discuss concerns. The teachers indicated they learn much more about their students in an academy setting. They said students having the same teachers and traveling from class to class with the same group of fellow studentsis a positive aspect. Having common goals helps to unify the teachers. Support is natural when the expectations are the same. Another positive aspect mentioned is the relationships developed with the other teachers that are in the academy.Question: “What are the negative aspects, if any, of teaching in an academy?”Many of the teachers indicated that the negative aspects related to time issues. Meetings absorb a large amount of the teachers planning time throughout the week. Phone calls every two weeks to a different group of parents can also take up time. The other issue that seemed to resonate among several of the teachers was that of interpersonal relationships among the team members. It takes a large amount of cooperation, flexibility, and good communication in order for the team of teachers to function together cohesively. If a teacher is assigned to this teaching position and does not buy in to the concept, they will have a hard time working in the team structure. There also was mentioned a concern that the older, veteran teachers’ opinions are not considered and valued as much as some of the younger team members.Question: “How does the academy structure affect student attendance and achievement?”The teachers stressed the importance of the common planning time in order to accomplish several goals. Attendance can be checked between teachers on a daily basis to see which students are attending some classes but skipping others. The time togetherenables teachers to have a stronger more unified message to the students. The common planning time is also used to bring in parents of students who are struggling academically or behaviorally and meet with all the teachers at once. The students understand that the teachers communicate regularly and that if there is a problem there will be a parent conference either by phone or in person. Another reason for the increased attendance is the positive relationships that are formed between the students and the teachers. Some teachers mentioned that while some progress has been made in the area of attendance, more work can still be done across the board to improve this area. Higher achievement is encouraged through the positive rewards recognizing the achievement.Question: “What advice do you have for other teachers working in an academy structure?”Buying into the concept completely and communicating clearly are the two points of emphasis expressed by the teachers. If a teacher does not buy in to or agree with the concept of the academy structure, they will become problematic. It is important to be a team player and do your part in helping the academy to be successful. Do not be afraid to speak up and share ideas. When ideas are communicated, it is important to value all input from every team member. Patience is an important attribute when working with other people. Communicate, communicate, communicate and work, work, work, were also included in the comments. Administrative support is a necessary ingredient for a successful academy.Question: “What conclusions have you drawn in regards to the academy structure at East High School?”The additional support provided to the freshman is crucial in making the transition into high school. It only works well if the teachers buy into the cooperative work structure of the academy. It is the best solution for a very difficult environment. The goals are accomplished much easier with a unified team working towards them, but differences in expectations can cause problems in reaching a consensus. Beware of old vs. young sentiments or any other issues that can divide rather than unify the team. The 4X4 block schedule helps bring academic success to the urban setting.Perspectives and Conclusions of the School AdministratorsThe school administrator questionnaire (Appendix M) was given to two public school administrators who are directly involved in the Freshman Success Academy at East High School. They are the principal of the school who has been an administrator for 22 years, 15 in an academy school and 7 in non-academy schools, and the assistant principal responsible for the freshman who has 13 years, 7 of those years in an academy school, of school administration experience.Question: “What are the critical components that must be in place within a school in order for the academy structure to be successful?”Common planning time for core academic teachers in every academy is essential.A schedule that works and is true to the academy model.A committed teaching staff is essential for success.\tTeacher buy-in and commitment.Support from the business community.Support from higher education.Work based learning.Mentoring program.Question: “What are the positive aspects, if any, of the academy structure in a school?”The relationships promoted in the academy structure seems to be the center of many of the positive aspects relating to this model. They include small learning communities with a common core of caring teachers. In these communities, the teachers and students can work together with a common goal. There is a practical focus for the staff and students. Mentoring, internships, and college opportunities in a chosen field while the students are still in high school are all positive parts of the academy model. Also, there is real career exploration that takes place naturally within the application of the academies.Question: “What are the negative aspects, if any, of the academy structure in a school?”The scheduling is much more complicated than the traditional school schedule. Non-cooperative team members can also end up being a negative aspect in the academy. The principal replied that there are no negative aspects associated with the academy model.Question: “In your experience, how does the academy structure affect the attendance and achievement of the students?”The teacher/student/parent relationship enhanced in the academy structure positively affects the attendance rate. There is a feeling of “togetherness” that is promoted. So, when the academy model is implemented correctly, attendance and achievement will significantly improve.Question: “What are your concluding thoughts with regard to the academy school structure?”This is the only way to go in a large urban school. If students feel welcomed and engaged both academically and socially, they have a much greater chance of being successful.“When implemented correctly, it is a way of providing students a supportive environment that allows them to bridge the gap between school and the working world. It allows for the practical application of the academies in a nurturing, caring environment.”Perspectives and Conclusions of StudentsTen students who had completed the Freshman Success Academy during the 2002-03 school year were chosen to receive and fill out the student questionnaire (Appendix O). They were also given a copy of the parent survey for their parents to fill out. They were promised a pizza party at lunch if they returned the questionnaires by a certain time. 8 of the 10 questionnaires were completed. The students included six boys and two girls. Their responses are summarized and shared here.Question: “Describe what things you liked, if any, about the Freshman Success Academy?”There were several different things that the students mentioned liking in the Freshmen Success Academy. They enjoyed the strong relationships that they developed with their freshman teachers. They liked the fact that if they did not understand something academically, there was always extra help available. They felt the teachers “broke things down” and made them easier to understand. Learning was more fun, and they learned more than they have ever learned before. The students also expressed thatthey could get help with things other than just academic issues – life issues. They really liked the Cleveland trip, the projects, the end of the year picnic, and the awards assemblies.Question: “Describe what things you did not like, if any, about the Freshman Success Academy?”One student expressed that at times he did not like the added attention he received. He said, “they are always on your back.” Another student mentioned specific teachers they did not like or with whom they did not get along. Yet another student expressed they did not like the other students who did not want to learn or do the work. And several students said they liked everything about the Freshman Success Academy.Question: “Do you feel that the Freshman Success Academy prepared you to be successful in high school? Explain.”Only one student responded no to this question. She said that the work was too easy, and that they weren’t given the opportunity to work on their own like they have to as sophomores. The other seven students responded with yeses for various reasons. One student said that the academy allowed the majority of the freshman to mature and become respectful of teachers. Another student said the teachers explained everything that goes on in high school and the importance of their grades in the college process very well.Another student made reference to the extra help available when he had trouble understanding. Several of the students simply said they learned a lot.Question: “What would you change, if anything, about the Freshman Success Academy?”One student replied that she would let the freshman students work more independently. Another student wanted to change the t-shirts. The other six students said that they would not change anything.Perspectives and Conclusions of ParentsThe parent questionnaire (Appendix N) was delivered to each parent by their child who was also filling out the student questionnaire. Therefore, I received back eight parent questionnaires which contained four questions each. The first three questions the parent simply had to circle a response out of the following choices: I strongly agree, I agree, I disagree, or undecided. The fourth question allowed them to share any comments they had regarding the Freshman Success Academy. Their responses are shared.Question: “Did you feel as if you were regularly contacted regarding your child’s progress?”For this question, there were six parents who circled “I strongly agree,” one parent who circled “I agree,” and one parent who circled “I disagree.”Question: “Did you feel more involved in your child’s education?”On this question, there were five parents who circle “I strongly agree,” two parents who circled “I agree,” and one parent who circled “I disagree.”Question: “Did you think your child’s academic achievement improved in the Freshman Success Academy?”For this question, there were three parents that circled “I strongly agree,” four parents that circled “I agree,” and again one parent that circled “I disagree.”Question: “Do you have any comments regarding your child’s experience in the Freshman Success Academy?”One parent had a few negative comments questioning the amount of contact he received from the teachers at regular intervals. He said that he would like earlier notification if his son is not performing well in a class. He also questioned how students were assigned to particular classes. Two parents commented on the great teachers in the Freshman Success Academy. The other five parents did not make any comments.Perspectives and Conclusions from ResearchersThe past year and a half of researching both the achievement gap existing between African-American and White students and possible solutions for this gap has been encouraging, challenging, and enlightening. As a teacher of African-American students, the researcher was challenged on a daily basis by the achievement gap. The researcher was forced to evaluate why his students achieved at a lower level and what he could do to improve achievement in his classroom. The findings, especially relating to the academy structure, were encouraging in the results achieved.The researcher became involved in teaching in the Freshman Success Academy at East High School at the beginning of the 2002-03 school year. He had taught at East High School for one year previous to this experience and had a total of eight years of teaching experience.In an urban setting, it is critical for schools to organize and structure themselves such that the students feel welcomed and have a sense of belonging. The majority of students come into school with many life issues that make learning more difficult.Therefore, it is imperative for schools to have a strategy for creating a safe and loving environment for the students. This makes the concept and model of smaller schools within a school (academy) a logical strategy for fulfilling this strategy. In order for this model to be successful, there must be some components in place within the school.Administrative support is a critical component in implementing a successful academy. Scheduling is more complex to ensure that there is a common planning period for all of the teachers within the academy. As the teachers come up with creative ideas and integrative learning projects, the administration must be willing to work with changes in the schedule and other issues that may arise. They must be willing to allow the caring group of teachers to become creative in their teaching strategies. The administration must recognize the priority that the freshman year is in helping students to transition into high school and propelling them on to future success.The teachers who teach in the academy are the key to forming and running a successful academy. Teachers must buy into the team concept completely and be willing to communicate and work closely with the other members of the team. They must truly care for the students they are entrusted to teach. They must be willing to work above and beyond what the contract requires for the benefit of the students. They must be willing to spend extra time contacting parents and increasing their involvement. The teachers must be committed to creating an environment where the students feel safe, loved, and accepted and still emphasizing the importance of learning. Without teachers who are committed to these things, the academy will not function any better than a traditional school.The vast majority of students with regular attendance in the Freshman Success Academy experienced academic and social success. Across the board amongst the freshman, academic achievement increased. This was reflected in the increasedattendance rate, increased number of students on the honor roll each nine weeks, and increased proficiency test scores. The students received constant reminders of what appropriate behavior and communication looked like in the classroom setting. The expectations and consequences for inappropriate behavior were clearly explained on a regular basis. As a result, discipline problems occurred less frequently.The researcher has concluded that educators need to address the issue of the achievement gap between African-American and White students by working to find things that schools can do to raise the achievement of all students regardless of race. Educators must evaluate the staff, policies, and procedures of their schools to see if changes are necessary in order to increase achievement. A specific plan must be formulated for each school and steps must be taken to implement and fulfill this plan. The implementation process must be evaluated and tweaked on a regular basis to make sure that the achievement of students remains the priority through each phase of reform. Staff who are not committed to this priority must be moved on if possible. Our goal as educators should be that there is truly no child left behind.Appendix ACourse Title Expectations and SyllabusTeacher’s name Room #Course Description: Describe the purpose of your class. (See Ms. Luaces’s Syllabus for ideas if you’re not sure where to start. She’s got a great example!)Goals and Objectives:Using bullet statements, define your goals and objectives for your class.Goals may be “to understand and use the five- paragraph essay”, or “to determine the differences between truth and propaganda”.Objectives may be “to discuss works of fiction by different authors”, or “to develop an understanding of slavery in America and its psychological, social, economic, and political affects on the United States and the rest of the world.” (Luaces, syllabus)Goals and objectives should also comply with proficiency standards and SLCs (if your curriculum has them from the district).Instructional Philosophy: Here, you will include some of the things you believe in, such as giving equal opportunities for all students; how you will be teaching your subject matter, such as using interdisciplinary instructional methods (cross-curriculum), speaking, writing, reading, discussing, using media, etc.; and your assessment, such as a straight-point scale, quizzes, notebooks, writing assignments, in-class work, and homework.Class Expectations:By using bullets, we will list our 10 values (as decided by the entire team) also our late policy and pass policy.Late policy: 10 pts. for attendance every day. 5 points if student is tardy (not in class after last bell), 0 points if student is absent. Attendance points can not be made up. Teachers: Mark in grade book • for present, for tardy, and X for absent.Pass policy: Ms. Luaces has designed sheets with 3 passes.

All team members are expected to attend all meetings.There may be a need to have an additional meeting day, but very seldom.Data will be turned in at the beginning of each Tuesday’s meetings. We will rotate duties of taking notes at all meetings. These notes will accompany the data that is turned into the central office.These meetings will cover all team issues, conduct student contract meetings and plan events. Please plan on approximately one hour for each meeting. Occasionally, we will have guest speakers and/or administration help us become more of a “team”.Appendix DPHONE CALLS ANDPARENTAL INVOLVEMENTThe East High School Freshman Success Academy will repeatedly attempt to meet and involve each parent. We believe that strong parent involvement is key to student achievement, appropriate behavior and the overall success of our students and ultimately our program.Teachers will be required to reach each parent (not an answering machine) of a designated group of students every two weeks.These phone calls and/or home visits will be documented and a component of our data collection process and turned in weekly.The content of these phone calls will be determined by individual teachers and any team events held. The initial phone call must only contain positive feedback and introductory comments. Please see administration if you need support on negative behavior prior to your first call. Or, hurry and get all calls in prior to any difficulties!Appendix EDATA COLLECTIONThe East High School Freshman Success Academy Teachers will have to collect data for each student each week. Teachers will need to keep accurate attendance records, grade updates, document parent phone calls, track conferences (with students and/or parents), list proficiency areas passed, and record students removed from the learning environment.This data will need to be reported to the lead teacher at the beginning of Tuesday’s team meeting. Data collection will be a necessary component in evaluating our successes as well as our students. We will have a building data coordinator that may also request additional information and assist us interpreting the information.Data collection is not simply “busy work” but will enable our academy to identify both strengths and weaknesses for continued improvement.Appendix FData Collection SheetMeeting Date\t\tTeacher\tTeam\tA\tor\tBConcerns:Appendix GTICKET INCENTIVE PROGRAMThe East High School Freshman Success Academy will employ a ticket incentive program. Each teacher will be given tickets weekly that may be given out as deemed necessary. Please give out all tickets weekly.Students are responsible for writing their name on the ticket and placing it in the can in Ms Heideman’s room #2 (for team A) and Ms. Luaces’s room #29 (for team B). Team members will draw weekly winners at team meetings.Winners will be announced in classes and allowed to choose one item from the prize drawer. Teachers will be responsible for helping their respective teams stock the prize drawer with various items.Appendix HASSEMBLIESThe East High School Freshman Success Academy is committed to honoring students and acknowledging accomplishments and marked improvement (no matter how small it may be ). Each nine weeks, teachers will nominate students in the following areas:110% effort Most improvedPerfect attendanceScholar (this is done with GPA) Outstanding student (not just GPA)Each nomination will be called to the stage and receive a certificate and a small award. This usually consists of a free food coupon. Each category will also have a winner that will receive a certificate, their name displayed in a plaque, a star student t- shirt and a prize. The prizes will hopefully be donated and can range from a backpack to a CD walkman.Teachers will need to nominate and vote on each category. Teachers also will help complete certificates and participate in each assembly. The 2nd and 4th assemblies will also include students being rewarded for each individual area they pass on proficiency.These assemblies not only honor students and raise self- esteem, they teach appropriate behavior and connect with parents in a positive manner. Hopefully, we can feature a guest feature at each assembly also.Teachers will need to help request donated items for each assembly to defer costs. Parents will also be notified about each assembly.Appendix IFollow Me To Honor Roll CertificateHONOR ROLL STUDENT:Follow Me To Honor RollI WOULD LIKE TO SPONSOR A FELLOW FRESHMANSTUDENT TO JOIN ME ON THE HONOR ROLL FOR THE SECOND GRADING PERIOD.SPONSORED STUDENT:INITIALS OF ACCEPTANCE:I WILL REMAIN ON THE HONOR ROLL AND WILL PULL A CLASSMATE ON WITH ME.Follow Me To Honor RollHONOR ROLL STUDENT:I WOULD LIKE TO SPONSOR A FELLOW FRESHMANSTUDENT TO JOIN ME ON THE HONOR ROLL FOR THE SECOND GRADING PERIOD.SPONSORED STUDENT:INITIALS OF ACCEPTANCE:I WILL REMAIN ON THE HONOR ROLL AND WILL PULL A CLASSMATE ON WITH ME.Appendix JPhone Log SheetFreshman Success Academy Phone LogStudent Name\t\t\t\tTeam A or B Phone #\t\tAlternate #\t\tContact Person\t Best Time to Call\tSections of the Proficiency Passed (check all that apply): W  R  M  C  S Teacher:\tDate:\tPerson spoken to:\tTopics discussed:Appendix KFreshman Academy Student Success ContractStudent’s Name:\t Date:\t Scheduled Review Date:\tStudent’s Strengths: 1)\t\t3)\t2)\t\t4)\tSignatures:\t\t\tAppendix LTeacher QuestionnaireThank you for sharing your time with me.

            "EXAMINING DIFFERENT SCHOOL STRUCTURES’ EFFECT ON REDUCING THE ACHIEVEMENT GAP BETWEEN AFRICAN-AMERICAN AND WHITE STUDENTSA thesis submitted in partial fulfillment of the requirements for the degree of Masters of EducationByERIC WILLIAM REINIB.A. Education, Cedarville University, 19952004Cedarville UniversityABSTRACTReini, Eric William. M.Ed. Education Department, Cedarville University, 2004. Examining Different School Structures’ effect on Reducing the Achievement Gap Between African-American and White Students.The fact that an achievement gap between White and African- American students exists is undisputed. The reasons for this gap are many and complex. Evidence does exist, though, that this gap can be narrowed and potentially eliminated. Evidence also exists that demonstrates that when the gap in academic achievement becomes equal African-Americans are more likely to complete college and earn nearly the same income as Whites. Educators must understand the many reasons for the achievement gap and find ways to narrow the gap and further ensure the future success of all students. It is the purpose for this thesis to explore the reasons for the achievement gap and some possible solutions for narrowing the gap. Specifically, the paper will show one possible solution – the Academy structure.TABLE OF CONTENTSACKNOWLEDGEMENTSMany individuals have helped and encouraged me as I have worked to complete graduate school and the writing of this thesis.

The gap is evident in test scores, graduation rates, and appears across the curriculum. It was narrowing through the decades of the 70’s and 80’s, but, in the 1990’s, the gap has widened somewhat. “By the end of high school, in fact, African American and Latino students have skills in both reading and mathematics that are the same as those of white students in the 8th grade.” (Haycock, 2001) According to the Ohio Department of Education, the data showing 6th graders who met the minimum state performance standards in reading and mathematics proficiency testing for 2000-01 revealed the glaring disparity amongst racial groups. In the mathematics section, 68.4 percent of white students met the standard compared to25.8 percent of African American students. In reading, 65.3 percent of white students met the standard compared to 25.0 percent of African American students. (Gehring, 2002) SAT scores revealed the continued inequality into the high school age as the average scores for white students on the verbal and math portions were 506 and 514 respectively in 2001, whereas African American students scored an average of 433 and 426 respectively. (Roach, 2001) The academic achievement gap between white students and minorities, particularly African Americans, is well documented.This data calls the researcher to question why this achievement gap exists and persists. There appears to be several factors that play a role in establishing the gap. Some of the factors are student related like poverty, family and community support, and negative peer pressure (Alson, 2003). There are also many factors that involve the school’s responsibility for the gap which include high standards, a challenging curriculum, extra help for students, teacher quality, and instructional quality. The focus of this paper will be the school’s role in eliminating or at least narrowing the gap.PurposeThe purpose of the research is to examine the achievement gap between White students and African American students and to evaluate a specific school structure’s effectiveness in narrowing the gap. The researcher will answer the question; does the Academy (school within a school) structure significantly reduce the achievement gap between African American and White students? The research will explain the educational challenges facing the African American student and describe some school related solutions for raising the achievement of these students.The challenges presented in narrowing the achievement gap and raising equity for all students must be confronted by schools. There is much work to be done and several key issues need to be addressed to improve the quality of education at all schools. Teacher and instructional quality must be a priority especially in high minority school settings where the achievement gap is prevalent. Schools with the most needs tend to not retain effective teachers and administrators.  This affects the quality of instructionpresented and facilitates an increasing achievement gap between white and minority students.Comprehensive school reform is necessary in many cases so that schools get organized in their approaches to counteracting the gap. Th reform makes possible changes needed in what is taught, how it is taught, and how it is assessed on a school- wide instead of class by class level (Codding, 2000). Comprehensive school reform affects all aspects at all levels of a school including leadership, management, organization, climate, use of money, and use of human resources. There are many models for comprehensive school reform, but this research will focus on the Academy (school within a school) structure and its’ effectiveness in narrowing the achievement gap.MethodologyIn order to answer the question of the efficiency of various school structures, specifically the Academy model, in improving the achievement gap, the paper will begin with an in depth look at the various literature written on the topic of the achievement gap. It attempts to read and assimilate the views and information out there regarding this topic. It will also attempt to identify possible causes and solutions for the achievement gap. The author accessed most of the previously conducted research through the ERIC database, Academic Search Premier, current journals, and the World Wide Web.The method of research will involve a correlative examination of two ninth grade classes at an urban high school whose demographic makeup consists of approximately 99 percent African American students. The classes will be evaluated in terms of state proficiency testing, academic achievement, and attendance. The first class evaluated will be the freshman class during the 1999-2000 school year who were a traditional freshman class. This will be the control group. The second class evaluated will be the freshman class during the 2002-03 school year because they had the full advantages afforded them in an organized, fully functioning Academy called the Freshman Success Academy. This will be the treatment group. Both of these classes will be evaluated to see if there is improvement in achievement with the Academy, and also if the Academy was successful in narrowing the achievement gap between African American and White students.Biblical IntegrationGod created every human in a unique and wonderful way. His plan was very specific as to the natural characteristics, personalities, aptitudes, and abilities according to Psalm 139:13-16. In Galatians 3:28 it says, “There is neither Jew nor Greek (racial differentiation), slave nor free (socioeconomic differentiation), male nor female (gender differentiation), for you are all one in Christ Jesus.” Equity in school is Biblical. This does not necessarily mean that all students should achieve at the same level as every individual is created uniquely. It does suggest that all students should have the same opportunity to achieve. The opportunity should include equity in teacher quality, curriculum quality, quality of instruction, and resources that are available.  Theopportunity should be the same for all students regardless of race, gender, or socioeconomic class.The education professional must be characterized by excellence because the stakes are so high. The profession works everyday with the future lives of children. The work done should be completed in such a way that lives are touched everyday and God is glorified through the efforts and the motivations exemplified in the profession. Colossians 3:23 says, “Whatever you do, work at it with all your heart, as working for the Lord, not for men.” The teaching profession must have people who are willing to work with all of their hearts in helping all students achieve their fullest potential. This is what is honoring to God.SettingEast High School in Columbus, Ohio is an urban high school whose population consists of almost all African American students. The school has implemented the Academy structure in the form of Career Academies. This was accomplished through grant money and an initiative called High Schools that Work.The general model consists of students entering the freshman year in a general college preparatory academy, and then at the end of their freshman year they choose a career academy that lines up with their career goals. The model is data-driven and involves breaking a large school population up into smaller units comparable to schools within a school. Teachers collaborate throughout the year by utilizing a common planning period. The goal is to cultivate relationships amongst and with the students thatcreate a safe and warm environment for the students. The purpose is to increase student achievement.SummaryThe presentation of research will examine the achievement gap existing between White and African American students. The reader will come to understand the breadth of the problem as well as many of the factors playing a role in the achievement gap. The reader will be presented with many of the issues needing to be addressed by schools in the effort to reach all students and raise achievement. The current Academy school structure will be evaluated as to whether or not it is a viable vehicle of comprehensive school reform in raising the achievement of African American students to a level more closely paralleling that of White students.Chapter 2: Literature ReviewSignificanceFor decades researchers have discussed and debated the lower levels of educational achievement of African-American compared with White students. This achievement gap exists in all school ages. Even when students arrive at kindergarten, the African-American students are considerably behind their White peers in measurable cognitive skills (Nettles, 2003, p.215).There is an endless list of possible reasons for this racial divide in achievement levels ranging from the following: linguistic incongruities between home and school culture; differing levels of parental involvement; lack of cultural and social capital; lower general socio-economic status; divergent study habits and motivational levels; the fear of “acting white”; lower teacher expectations, and the quantity and quality of material they are exposed to (Nettles, 2003, p. 216).Statistics regarding the existence of an achievement gap.Between 1970 and 1988, the achievement gap between African-American and White students declined continuously until it was cut by fifty percent. Then, throughout the 1990’s, the achievement gap began to widen again. To explain this widening of the gap, it is necessary to closely examine what is going on (Haycock, 2001, p.6).There are several achievement patterns which are worthy of noting. In 1999, 1 in 100 African-American 17-year-olds can read and gather information from a specialized text (such as a science article in a magazine) compared to 1 in 12 White students. 1 in 100 African-American students can comfortably solve multi-step problems compared to about 1 in 10 White students. The ratio of African-American students to White students who are able to compute fractions, solve percents, and calculate averages was 30 percent to 70 percent. In the 18-24 age group, 90 percent of Whites have either completed high school or earned a GED while the percentage of African-Americans drops to 81. Approximately 76 percent of White high school graduates go directly to college, while 71 percent of African-Americans will go. African-Americans are only half as likely to earn a bachelors degree by the age of 29 as Whites. These statistics do indicate an achievement gap trend between races (Haycock, 2001, p.7).Achievement Gap Statistics for Ohio SchoolsIn Ohio, the statistics are just as alarming. For example, in 7th grade, only 11 percent of African-American students passed all five parts of the states new proficiency test, compared with 43 percent of White students. In 2001, only 59 percent of African- American students graduated from high school, compared with 85 percent of White students. Data released comparing sixth graders were as follows: students passing the math proficiency test – 68.4 percent of White students and 25.8 percent of African-American students; and students passing the reading proficiency test – 65.3 percent of White students and 25.0 percent of African-American students (Gehring, 2002, pp.20- 21).Also in Ohio, 79 percent of White 9th graders performed at or above the passing rate for the Ohio 9th Grade Math Proficiency Test, compared to only 38 percent of the African-American 9th graders. This means that 62 percent of African-American 9th graders in Ohio are not passing, compared to only 21 percent of White 9th graders. According to the 2000 National Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP), Ohio’s African-American-White achievement gap falls 11th among all of the states. This puts Ohio in the top quartile among states on the NAEP math assessment (The Education Trust, 2003).The achievement gap is also apparent in the number of students successfully taking Advanced Placement (AP) courses and the end of the year exams. In 2000-2001, of the students taking AP exams in Ohio, 4 percent of the test-takers were African- American and 89 percent of them were White on the Calculus AB exam. Of the students taking the exam, 31 percent of the African-American students earned scores of 3, 4, or 5 (passing scores), compared to 69 percent of White students. On the AP English Language and Composition exam, 5 percent of the test-takers were African-American and 90 percent were White, and, of those who took this exam, the number of passers was similar - 31 percent African-American and 68 percent White. Finally, in the AP Biology course, 4 percent of the course-takers were African-American and 85 percent were White.The number of students passing the exam was as follows: 15 percent of the African- American students and 57 percent of the White students passed (The Education Trust, 2003).Data gathered from the SAT college achievement test also indicated a gap between African-American and White high school seniors. On the math portion of the test, the average score in 2001 for White students taking the test was 531 compared to an average score of 426 for African-American students. The gap is obvious in the average verbal scores as well; White students earned a 529 while African-Americans earned a 433 average score. College Board President Gaston Caperton responded to this data saying, “The score gaps for different racial, ethnic, and socioeconomic groups that we see on the SAT also appear on virtually every measure of achievement, including other standardized tests and classroom grades, and they show up as early as fourth grade. These differences are a powerful illustration of a persistent social problem in our country: inequitable access to high-quality education (Roach, 2001, p. 12).”According to two international surveys, the Trends in International Mathematics and Science Study (TIMSS) and the Program for International Student Assessment (PISA), the gap between low achievers and average students persist internationally. The gap does not seem to be dependent upon the wealth and prosperity of the country. Wealthier countries such as Portugal, Italy, and the United States have a much higher achievement gap than many poorer countries such as South Korea. The study notes thatstudent achievement seems to be closely linked to the students’ family backgrounds (Borja, 2002, p. 10).Data indicates the achievement gap is accompanied by a teacher gap. Quality Counts 2003 is a report, compiled by Richard Ingersoll of the University of Pennsylvania, analyzing public school students’ access to qualified teachers. The data reveals 32 percent of high school students in high-poverty schools take a class with a teacher that did not even minor in the subject that he or she teaches, compared to only 22 percent in low poverty schools. This percentage increases to more than 50 percent in the middle school grades in high poverty schools, compared to 44 percent in low poverty schools. 70 percent of students in low poverty secondary schools have teachers who have both majored in and become licensed in the subjects they teach, compared to about 50 percent of high poverty schools. Finally, students in high poverty schools are more likely to be taught by less-experienced teachers. Less than 9 percent of teachers in low poverty schools have fewer than 3 years of teaching experience, whereas more than 13 percent of teachers in high poverty schools have little teaching experience (Heimel, 2003, p.18).The issue of “white flight” to non-public schools and its’ affect on public schools is a possible concern which may be affecting achievement in certain school settings. After several statistical analyses, there does seem to be a correlation between the percentage of white students enrolled in non-public schools and the concentration of minorities in the public schools. Secondly, white enrollment does make a difference inthe public schools. “The black-white gap is greater in districts with many whites in non- public schools (Bankston, Caldas, 2000, pp. 539-550).”Analysis of the Statistics.Historically, African-American youth have been thought to have done better if they adopted a Eurocentric cultural value system. In order for them to achieve, they had to “act white.” The findings of this study were these students showed high self-esteem and achievement goals in conjunction with Afro-centricity. The findings revealed that when achievement test scores were the measure of performance, the low scores were associated with the Eurocentric racial attitudes. On the contrary, high self-esteem and achievement goals were associated with an Afro-centric view of self (Spencer, 2001, pp. 21-30).A study was completed that measured the gap between ethnic groups by assessing data on the National Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP) and SAT results. It offered an in depth look at the available data on the Black-White and Hispanic- White gap in the areas of reading and mathematics. It sought to answer the question as to why the gap seemed to decrease in the 1970’s and early 1980’s but then appeared to widen again in the 1990’s. The study addresses many factors perceived as reasons for these phenomena such as: changes in socioeconomic and family conditions, changes in youth culture and student behaviors, and changes in schooling conditions and practices.The study concludes that much ground overall has been covered in narrowing the racial and ethnic gap over the last three decades. It appears that many of the gains made duringthe first two decades occurred at the basic skills level and then the gap grew again when the emphasis shifted toward the advanced skills level during the 1980’s. The study states that the factors that have been attributed to the gap do not easily explain the current widening of the gap and that further research is necessary across multiple fields of study (Lee, 2002, pp. 3-12).Another study attempted to identify if after school activities affected achievement of 8th and 10th grade students and students of different ethnicity. They looked at the two opposing views on the subject – zero-sum concept (extra activities just take time away from students that they should use to study) and the view that these activities provide an experience that contributes to the overall development of the student. The study used the National Education Longitudinal Study (NELS 1988) and it included 8th and 10th grade students whose data on the test were complete. The study evaluated the students’ scores in several content areas and categorized the students’ pursuits on the basis of in or out of school, academic or nonacademic, and organized or nonorganized. The study concluded that academic pursuits seemed to be consistently related to achievement, while nonacademic pursuits were not significantly related to achievement. These results indicated that the affect was different among differing ethnicities, but it did not go into any depth with this observation (Schreiber, 2002, pp. 10-100).Another study compares the educational expectations of parents and the influence these expectations have on students of different races. The authors differentiate between the whites and the African-American/Hispanic in that the expectations are generallyhigher. The exception to this is the African-American father due to the lack of a father figure in most cases. The conclusion was as follows: “As we have shown, the aspirations of close relatives and parents, but not those of teachers and peers, have differential effects on students’ educational expectations, pointing to the importance of examining the unique family and social contexts in which students of different races live in America (Cheng, 2002, pp. 306-327).”In another study, evidence is described which shows achievement gaps in mathematics between Black and White students. The study also examined how the socio- economic status (SES) of the students affects the gap. It found SES had little affect in the disparity of achievement levels. The gap had narrowed for nearly two decades during the 1970’s and the 1980’s, but started widening again during the 1990’s. The researcher evaluated the differences in instructional practices in primarily white and black classrooms. The research identified some key differences in instructional belief and practices between teachers of White and Black students. Teachers of White students focused more on reasoning skills and problem solving, whereas teachers of black students focused on single solution and drill-based instructional strategies. There were also discrepancies found in student course taking and beliefs between these two groups. The study concluded there are disparities between Black and White students’ achievement, and this is regardless of their SES status (Lubienski, 2002, pp.269-287).Another study took a quantitative approach to show evidence that, for black and white students, environment (American vs. foreign born) plays a decisive role indetermining their success in precalculus. They showed the preparation in “Later Skills” (the math skills most necessary for success in advanced math courses) was further achieved by those who were foreign born. The study involved a sample from a public university in New York with 2,005 students who were broken down by gender, ethnicity, age, and birthplace. The instrument used was a CEEB Elementary Algebra Skills Test. The study took place at a four year college. They then compared the scores achieved on the test to the grade performance in precalculus. The conclusion was that foreign-born students were better prepared than American Whites, Blacks, and Hispanics in the “Later Skills.” Therefore, the results point to the environment playing a decisive role in the development of “Later Skills” and, thus, subsequent success in precalculus (Baranchik, 2002, pp. 253-267).Even long after the 1954 U.S. Supreme Court decision in Brown v. Board of Education, segregated schools continue due to a combination of continued residential segregation and the tradition of neighborhood school assignment. Over 67 percent of African-American students attend majority minority schools and 33 percent attend schools with more than 90 percent minority enrollment. On the other hand, over 90 percent of White students attend school in White majority districts. This has led to serious negative ramifications for most African-American students. Majority minority school districts have a more difficult time attracting and retaining qualified teachers. Oftentimes students are not offered access to advanced coursework and information about college entrance requirements (Nettles, 2003, pp. 218-219).What students say/think about the Achievement Gap.The way students think and feel is important to consider. In order to close the achievement gap in math and science, we must first give students the confidence and the opportunities to succeed. Courses should be offered to prepare students for standardized tests, and the importance of these tests should be emphasized to minority and low income students. Parent’s help and involvement should be solicited as part of their child’s education. Schools should provide “Summer Bridge” learning opportunities and mentor programs to link student’s educational experiences to the world of work. Students should be provided with every possible resource and opportunity to help them achieve academic success (Hrabowski, 2003, pp. 44-48)Good teaching is extremely important and has been shown to impact the achievement of students. A study evaluated teachers through the eyes of students in an urban school setting. The students interviewed spoke of good teachers who held high expectations for them and held them to that high standard. The students stressed the importance of good teaching that results in learning. The students also spoke favorably of the block schedule claiming they learned better because the schedule forced teachers to become better at teaching. “Students simply wanted good teachers because such teachers made them learn - often in spite of themselves (Corbett, 2002, pp. 18-22).”Oftentimes, minority students are not aware of the perception their school and race achieves far below the standard. When the data was revealed to students in a Philadelphia inner-city school, the students gave the following primary responses as reasons for the lower scores: 31 percent indicated the students held themselves responsible, 24 percent referred to teacher behavior, 18 percent indicated their parents’ role, 13 percent discussed the schools themselves, and 11 percent referred to the students’ environment or community. They also included poverty and peer pressure in their responses. The students described teachers as unsupportive – “they just hand out the work and expect us to do it without doing much teaching.” The students wanted their parents to take a more active role in being involved in their education. The students wanted schools to hold them to higher expectations and provide curriculum that was challenging. Many of the students felt trapped in their home environment, and they felt that if they tried to improve their performance then they would be perceived as “acting white.” Communities and schools must come together, decide what they value for young people, and support that with all of their effort (Taylor, 2003, pp.72-75).Identifying the Causes for the Gap.Society and adults tend to claim the reasons for the achievement gap between races can be traced back to things outside of the school’s control, such as, lack of familial support, low socio-economic status, and lack of adequate basic needs (food, clothing, etc.). Students tend to communicate some different sources for the gap, such as, poorly prepared teachers, low expectations, and boring, non-challenging curriculum as biggerreasons for the achievement gap. The data seems to support what the students are saying. It shows that education takes the students who begin with less and systematically give them less in the schools. This does not diminish the role outside influences play in the education of students, but, rather, it says that what schools do matters greatly in the lives and education of these “disadvantaged” students (Haycock, 2001, p. 7-8).Research consistently reports a strong relationship between social class and performance on standardized tests such as the SAT. Many researchers have concluded one avenue through which socio-economic status affects achievement in high school is the academic courses the students take. Historically, high schools commonly placed students and organized their curricula by tracking, where students are placed in a set of courses based on their perceived educational ability. Although many high schools have replaced formal tracking with student choice as the means by which students are placed in courses, the relationship between students’ choice and their personal backgrounds resembles that found within traditional tracking curricula (Nettles, 2003, p.217).Teacher quality is an important issue affecting the achievement gap. As important as qualified teachers are, the amount of out-of-field teachers remains unacceptably high. In 1999-2000 school year, high poverty ad high minority schools had between 29 and 34 percent of core academic courses taught by out-of-field teachers. Poor and minority students are more than twice as likely to serve as a training ground for inexperienced or uncertified teachers as the average child (Jerald, 2002, pp. 1-9).Some Solutions for the Gap.The focus of education should be placed on the individual learner and on an understanding of the learning process. It should involve sensitivity to the diverse backgrounds of students and a certain level of connectedness between caring teachers and students. The focus should involve the breakdown of fragmented schools and evolve into collaborative efforts between teachers who are no longer isolated from one another. (McCombs, 2000, pp. 29-36).One school (Francis Bacon) narrowed the achievement gap by first focusing on behavior management and then researched strategies for raising academic achievement. The school concluded it is important to have high expectations for the students and to have a good vehicle for instruction to help the students meet those expectations. Collaboration between teachers is another important component in improving the achievement gap. “An isolated teacher can’t be successful. Teacher collaboration and teacher training are critical.” Another essential element is after school programs that help students to finish their homework. “When students get the right encouragement from a caring person, research shows, they can defy the odds (Quindlen, 2002, pp. 5-8).”Another important aspect in closing the achievement gap is comprehensive school reform. This includes an overall reorganization laying out high expectations and a specific plan of how the school will achieve those expectations. A high school in California went through this process with great success.  “The college board had justcome out with a report that showed a very high correlation between passing algebra and geometry in high school and later academic success.” So this school decided to make this a primary target in their reform process. Math became the backbone for the academic schedule for the students (Codding, 2000, pp. 79-92).The issue of minority student’s attitudes toward math and science achievement is important in reducing the achievement gap and promoting academic success amongst minority students. There is “a striking gap between students’ expectations regarding future careers and their understanding of the impact of current course decisions on these plans.” Minority students are less likely to attend schools offering advanced placement courses. These students are more likely to encounter negative peer pressure in their decisions to enroll in math and science courses. To succeed in advanced math courses, persistence is necessary, whereas, the basic math courses required for everyone can be passed by students who simply do the work. These courses are not enough to teach the persistence that is necessary for these students to become successful working in a math or science field. “A recent study ... showed that student attitudes toward mathematics are extremely important and play a large part in determining students’ motivation toward instruction and achievement.” Therefore, success in math courses and particularly advanced math courses is critical to the academic success of the student (Gilroy, 2002, pp. 39-44).Title 1, of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965, has had an effect on the achievement gap particularly in high poverty contexts. During the 1970’s and 1980’s the gap decreased by about two grade levels.  It is assumed that thisimprovement was in direct relation to the funding made available to counteract poverty, and, thus, continued funding is vital to continued improvement in the gap between white and black students. The importance of early childhood education and summer learning opportunities for children in poverty situations needs to continue to be an emphasis of this funding. Comprehensive school reform which focuses on reorganizing and revitalizing the entire school and reducing the student-teacher ratio is another important aspect of this funding (Borman, 2003, pp. 49-53).The Minority Student Achievement Network is a consortium of 15 school districts with high achievement levels but significant gaps in achievement between white students and their African-American or Latino peers. They have banded together to examine and evaluate data in an effort to emphasize the achievement of students of color. “The Network agrees wholeheartedly that the causes of the achievement gap are neither differences in innate ability nor the result of biased test questions (Kober, 2001),” and the gap is both complex and systemic. The group is concerned with the fact that the Black and Latino students with college educated parents scored lower on a 12th grade reading test than their white peers whose parents only had a high school diploma. They assert that socioeconomic factors account for only part of the achievement gap. The network members agree there are many factors that influence in varying degrees the gap including (but not limited to) racism, poverty, poor educational leadership, low teacher’ expectations, negative peer pressure, etc. (Alson, 2003, pp. 76-78).Comprehensive School ReformThe dominant strategy for school reform has historically consisted of systemic changes to things like standards, assessments, accountability, governance (vouchers and charters), and funding plans. These systemic reforms are policies government at the federal, state, or local levels can prescribe to large numbers of schools. These reforms have little direct influence on the methods and materials used within the classroom to ensure success. Comprehensive school reform shares the goal of systemic school reform – improved student achievement on a broad scale. The difference is comprehensive school reform begins by considering the school as the unit of reform. Ultimately, comprehensive school reform intends to affect every aspect of school functioning. The different models vary considerably, but they all aim to affect curriculum, instruction, assessment, school organization, necessary support for students having difficulties, parental involvement, and sustained professional development for the staff. Because this reform begins at the school level, staff buy-in is critical to establish prior to implementing the reform (Slavin, 2001, pp 22-23).If a large high school with a high poverty student population has major problems of absenteeism, low test scores, and high drop-out rates, the only solution is a powerful comprehensive school reform which can turn the school around and keep it strong. A comprehensive package of changes establishing new structures and conditions which promote positive human relationships and effective learning opportunities is needed in large, high poverty high schools (Jordan, 2000, pp.159-160).The first requirement of reform is to create a school environment which is conducive to learning and to improve student attendance. The school authority must be clearly and visibly in charge of discipline, and they must convey the message that this is a “real school” in which high academic achievement is expected from all students. The reforms must promote conditions where respectful and caring relationships can be developed between teachers and students. Discipline problems should fade so that administrators can rule without resentment. A high priority must be placed on student attendance so that there is the opportunity to increase learning (Jordan, 2000, p. 161).High schools that are large and departmentalized are often cited as a contributing factor to a climate where discipline is weak and students feel estranged from the school. The teacher to student ratio is so large students who misbehave can become anonymous and escape the regular, effective control of the school (Lee, 1995, pp. 243-245).Curriculum and instruction must be addressed in comprehensive school reform. The curriculum in large, high-poverty schools is too often unchallenging and uninteresting. Usually, low-level and watered-down courses are offered to everyone except the advanced, college-bound students (Jordan, 2000, p.162). These course offerings continue even though there is a consensus that most students will benefit from a core curriculum with high standards which contains demanding material (Lucas, 1999). Classroom instruction continues to consist of teacher-led lectures and individual worksheets which emphasize drill and practice of isolated facts and formulas.  Absentfrom instruction are student learning activities which incorporate cooperative learning and project-based instruction that encourage a deeper understanding of the content and practical applications (Darling-Hammond, 1997).If staff are expected and encouraged to use new curriculum and try new instructional methodology, they need to receive high-level professional training and direct assistance with their classes. Currently, most secondary teachers teach and learn alone. Professional development and training is a necessary component to successful comprehensive school reform (Jordan, 2000, pp. 162-163).Talent Development ModelOne model of comprehensive school reform, called the Talent Development Model, was designed to address the problem of large, urban, nonselective high schools. It was researched and developed at Johns Hopkins University and implemented in Patterson High School in Baltimore. This school was chosen for the reforms because it represented one of the poorest educational environments in the state of Maryland (Jordan, 2000, p. 164).The Talent Development Model contains two organizational reform components. The first is the Academy structure which reduces student apathy and anonymity by creating smaller, more personalized learning communities. The upper grades choose a career focus for their curriculum. The second component is the Twilight School whichprovides recovery opportunities for students with serious discipline problems (Jordan, 2000, p. 165).Career Academy ProgramsHigh school career academies were originally designed to address the needs of at risk students. One of the suggested reasons that at risk students do not achieve in school is they feel school is irrelevant to the real world. Career academies bridge the world of academia and the real world of work. A career academy is a type of comprehensive school reform that has several defining characteristics. The academy is a “school-within- a-school” in the high school grades run by a small team of teachers from various disciplines. The academy recruits students who volunteer for the program and demonstrate their commitment through an application process. The career academy focuses on a theme in a field in which demand is growing and good employment opportunities exist in the local labor market. The curriculum combines technical and academic courses each semester. The academy includes general employment skills while keeping the option of attending college open to all of its students. The academy provides opportunities for students to be employed part-time during the school year and full-time during vacation times in the field of their academy. The career academy involves representatives from the field of employment to help plan and guide the program. These representatives are involved as speakers, field trip hosts, job supervisors, and mentors for individual students. The academy contributes to the students’ sense of membership in acaring school community through smaller class sizes than a typical high school, a system of motivation and rewards, and regular contact with their parents. The career academy has the capability of utilizing funds from a variety of community, government, and business sources. A successful career academy is designed with these characteristics as a guide (Stern, 1992).Each academy is self-contained. They are each led by an administrative team consisting of an academy principal (usually an assistant principal) and an academy instructional leader (usually the department chair of the subject most closely associated with the academy). There is one guidance counselor per academy. To further solidify their unique identities, academies may select banners and mottoes to decorate hallways and staircases (Jordan, 2000, p. 166).As with any reform movement, several obstacles will exist that must be overcome. Career academies are no exception to this rule. Guidelines for control over the necessary funds to run a successful career academy must be established between the school district, funding agencies, and the staff who implement the program. Apathy amongst the staff must be overcome or avoided in order for a fully functional academy to run effectively. This must be considered as staff are chosen or hired who will be involved in the academy. Union contract guidelines must also be considered in this process. Full administrative support is a critical component in a career academy. These are some of the obstacles that must be considered and overcome when implementing a career academy into a high school (Shorr, 1999, pp. 381-382).Collaboration amongst the staff is an important element in a functioning career academy. Common planning times amongst all the staff in the academy are necessary so that weekly meetings can be held to facilitate this collaboration. During this meeting time, the bond between staff can be strengthened while instructional, motivational, and cooperative strategies can be planned (Shorr, 1999, p. 383)Professional development and training for the staff is another key component for the career academies. Training is necessary in order for teachers to learn to collaborate and educate in a cooperative manner. Special training is also necessary for teachers to learn to integrate the technology required by the academy focus into the curricula for each of their classes (Shorr, 1999, p. 383).Industry and community partnerships play an important role in a successful career academy. Representatives from the industry by which the academy is focused participate as important partners in all aspects of the career academy. Members of the community also can help staff members make additional connections with other potential industry participants who did not originally share the enthusiasm for becoming involved with high school students who are considered at risk (Shorr, 1999, pp. 383-384).In career academies, curriculum is developed combining learning outcomes from several disciplines with the advantages of team teaching and computer technologies. The curriculum should be designed thematically to incorporate the technology and principlesof the career field the academy is based upon. Using technology, teachers can design projects based on the tenets of the career academy by utilizing components of the career academy such as special speakers, field trips, mentors, internships, and parents. Classes are blocked into adjacent time periods to allow for plenty of time to accomplish the tasks and activities associated with a major project. The projects are designed in such a way that they lead up to a culminating senior project that incorporates all that they have learned through their years in the career academy. This senior project would be a large part of a portfolio the students would compile to present to a future employer demonstrating the skills and knowledge they have acquired through participation in the career academy (Shorr, 1999, pp.384-386).Students follow a block schedule for their classes throughout the day. Students move together from class to class. The block typically consumes either the entire morning or afternoon, and the academy teachers decide on how to divide up the time. Block scheduling allows for more flexibility in class length permitting classes to be longer or shorter, as necessary.Extra help is available through a variety of avenues in the career academy. Students who obtain a grade lower than a C must participate in tutoring sessions occurring before or after school until their grade rises to a C or better. The tutoring is also available to all of the students on a voluntary basis. Community volunteers, parents, and retired citizens are recruited to work as tutors for the students (Shorr, 1999, p. 386).A mentoring program in which industry, community, and business people are paired up one on one with a high school student is a part of the career academy model. The mentor works with the student and provides guidance, instruction, and an example of how to use education to become successful in life. A study at Colombia University investigated the lives of 100 prominent Americans and found that those who came from a disadvantaged background were especially likely to cite the influence of a mentor as a key to their success (Rutherford, 1998, pp.78-86). A major goal of the mentoring program is to introduce the students to the world of work as many of them come from poor urban or immigrant families (Shorr, 1999, p.386).The internship program is a vital link in the career academy between the school training and the labor market. Students are exposed to the world of work and to a variety of opportunities that exist in the field they have chosen. The combination of practical experience and educational training provides motivation to the students and ensures that they receive training that is compatible with the local labor market. Internships usually begin as unpaid experiences, but often lead to paid opportunities (Shorr, 1999, p.388).Twilight SchoolThe other organizational component of the Talent Development Model is the Twilight School. This is an after-hours, on-site, short-term alternative program for a small group of students who have serious discipline and attendance issues. Twilight School meets for three hours each day after the regular program is dismissed.  Thesmaller classes are for those students who are coming from juvenile justice institutions and court referrals, or for those who have regular confrontations with teachers or other students disturbing the learning environment for the rest of the class. These classes are taught by regular day school faculty who are working on overtime. Students in Twilight School take three academic courses which are the same as day school courses so that they can return to day school any time they are ready (Jordan, 2000, p. 170).Outcomes of Career AcademiesSchools that have implemented career academies have reported positive results. Hollywood High School, in Hollywood, CA, (78 percent minority population and 85 percent free or reduced lunch population) gives testimony to improved results in several key areas. There was an 83 percent graduation rate for those students who completed the academy program compared to 35 percent that were not in the program. The senior project generated enough enthusiasm that 100 percent of participating students completed the project satisfactorily. More than 65 percent of the students received scholarships to 2- and 4-year colleges and universities (Shorr, 1999, pp. 388-389).In other studies of career academies, similar positive results were reported. Attendance rates increased by between 10 and 20 percentage points which probably accounts for the improvement in grades and graduation rates (Elliott, 2002, p. 88).Possible Reasons Why Career Academies Promote Higher AchievementOne of the more obvious reasons career academies seem to be effective is the identifiable core of teachers and students that belong to the academy. Teachers identify themselves with the academy, regardless of whether they have classes containing only academy students. These teachers know who the academy students are, share information about these students, and intensively tracks these students’ behavior and absences – even more so than for other non-academy students (Hanser, 2000, p.33).Even more important than the teachers who identify themselves with the academy, the students identify themselves as being a part of a special program. Students express their feelings toward the academy as a tight-knit, family unit. Students are aware of the fact that the teachers share information about them and monitor their progress and development. Students notice the increased attention they receive both inside and outside of the classroom. They recognize more positive communication between their teachers and parents. While the vocational opportunities afforded to the students through the career academies may motivate students, research indicates that the nurturing environment offered to students in this atmosphere is the major factor in improving achievement (Elliott, 2002, pp. 88-89).Chapter 3: The Effectiveness of Career AcademiesIntroductionOver the past twenty years, there has been extensive research on education reform focusing on the achievement gap between white and minority students. East High School in Columbus, Ohio, an inner-city school whose demographics are 97 percent African- American, has implemented a possible solution to improve student achievement within the school and to narrow the achievement gap between African-American and White students. The program, which has been implemented into four low performing high schools in Columbus, is called Columbus Pathways to Success Initiative. This program is based on research-based model called the Talent Development model out of Johns Hopkins University. The comprehensive reform model was implemented at East High School and was structured by High Schools That Work, a non-profit comprehensive school reform organization that is funded by grant money.Columbus Pathways to Success Initiative (CPSI)CPSI is a high school reform model developed in 1999 based on High-Schools- That-Work and other nationally recognized reform models. This initiative is a collaborative effort between the Columbus Public Schools, the Columbus Chamber of Commerce, Columbus Education Association, Columbus State Community College, and other post secondary institutions.  It was initiated by the Chamber of Commerce as aneffort to develop the future workforce within Columbus instead of drawing people from other places. The rationale for the school system is to improve the student retention rate and to improve student achievement. There are several components within the CPSI which include the following: Freshman Success Academy, Acceleration Academy, a summer bridge program, career academies, teacher advisement program, staff development, public relations, data collection, analysis, and recommendations.High-Schools-That-WorkThere are several key practices that are adopted by schools that follow this model of school reform. High-Schools-That-Work (HSTW) is a comprehensive reform grant that works with the school and provides funding to implement these practices. It provides professional development for staff and funding for extra positions and programs necessary for this reform to be successful.There are three goals of HSTW. The first goal is to increase achievement in mathematics, science, communication, problem-solving, and technical skills. Another goal is to blend the content of traditional college preparatory courses with quality vocational and technical studies. The third goal is to advance policies and leadership initiatives necessary to sustain a continuous school-improvement effort.At the high school level, HSTW advocates ten key practices essential for reform to be successful in increasing student achievement. The first key practice is setting highexpectations and getting more and more students to meet them. Incorporating vocational studies into the regular curriculum is another key practice. The emphasis in these studies is using high level mathematics, science, language arts, and problem solving skills in the modern workplace. The academic studies should increase student access to academics that teach the essential concepts from the college preparatory curriculum by incorporating real-world problems and projects into the lessons. The program of study should be challenging with an upgraded academic core and a major emphasis. The course of study will give students and parents a system integrating school-based and work-based learning. The learning would span across high school and post-secondary studies. The fifth key practice involves teachers working together. Organization, structure, and scheduling should give academic and vocational teachers the time to plan and deliver integrated instruction aimed at teaching high-level content. Another key practice is getting students actively engaged in rigorous and challenging learning. Each student and his/her parent should receive guidance and advisement ensuring the completion of an accelerated program of study. The ninth key practice is to provide a structured system of extra help to enable students with inadequate preparation to complete a high-level program of study. The last key practice advocated by HSTW is to use student assessment and evaluation data to continuously improve school climate, organization, management, curriculum, and instruction. The purpose of this data analysis is to promote student learning and to recognize students who meet performance goals. When these practices are adhered to, reform is successful, student achievement is increased, and the school improves continuously.The Talent Development ModelThe Talent Development Model was formulated at Johns Hopkins University and implemented into a few high schools in Baltimore, Maryland. This model incorporates several components which were adapted and used at East High School. The two major components originating in the Talent Development Model used at East High School were the career academies (curriculum with a focus on future career skills) and twilight school (an after-school program for students who are unable to successfully function in a traditional classroom).Academic EmergencyAs part of the federal government’s education reform initiative, No Child Left Behind, schools that meet a certain number of criteria are labeled into different categories. Columbus Public Schools and East High School was in the lowest category, academic emergency. During the summer following the 2002-2003 school year, Columbus Public Schools were moved out of the academic emergency and into the academic watch category on the state report card.Career AcademiesThe model chosen for continuous improvement was career academies. The model organizes large schools into smaller learning communities called “schools within aschool” or academies. Freshman entering the school are part of the Freshman Success Academy which will be explained in great detail later in the research. Upon successful completion of the freshman year, students are required to select a career academy based on their future interests. The students have four possibilities to choose from which include the following career academies: Health Sciences, Arts and Communications, ACE (Architecture, Construction, and Engineering), and TEAM (Technology, Engineering, and Manufacturing). The students are then organized by academy into smaller groups who travel together between classes and have the same team of teachers in their core-academic classes for three years. The classes are all centered on the theme of their career academy, and the students have opportunities at earning college credit, experiencing valuable internships, gaining important know-how, and learning from a mentor from the business community. Students in the career academies will have the opportunity to earn for free up to 45 college credits and will leave high school with the promise of a job. The career academy gives focus and purpose to the high school academic experience.Architecture, Construction, and Engineering Academy (ACE)The ACE academy focuses primarily on the building trades. As sophomores, the students take typical college preparatory courses in addition to electives centered on the trades including an introductory foundation class for the academy. The students have theopportunity to take classes to learn such skills as Auto-CAD, mechanical drawing, and basic construction skills.After their sophomore year, students have three options within the ACE Academy. They may choose from one of the following: architectural/civil technology, mechanical technology, or structural technology. Then, during their junior and senior years, the students continue to take their college preparatory classes at East, but they spend half of their time at a vocational career center receiving hands-on training in a specific trade. The core academic classes have incorporated into them projects and an emphasis centered on the construction trades. Students have the opportunity to volunteer their time to work on building projects outside of the school setting through Habitat for Humanity and other non-profit organizations. The academy has several business partners in the community that provide opportunities for professional development, field trips, and special speakers. These business partners also provide internship opportunities and mentors for the students. During the summer between their junior and senior years, the students are involved in an internship with a business partner and are enrolled in college classes where they can earn college credit. Students would choose this academy if they had an interest in the construction trades, architecture, or engineering.Upon graduation, having come through the ACE Academy, the students would be ready to enter a post-secondary institution in any of the following programs: architecture, civil engineering technology, construction management, heating, ventilation, and air- conditioning technology. If their goals do not include further education, they would beadequately prepared for the work force. Their previous work experience would be such that they would qualify for many jobs requiring such previous experience. Students also have had many opportunities to meet and network with people in the industry. The ACE Academy is sponsored by the Columbus Chamber of Commerce.Arts and Communication AcademyThe Arts and Communication (A&C) Academy is for those students who are artistically inclined and would enjoy creating, performing, or writing. The students in this academy would follow a similar college preparatory schedule during their freshman (FSA) and sophomore year as the students in the ACE Academy. Their schedule would include Career Connections during their freshman year and a Foundations course during their sophomore year.At the end of their sophomore year, students have the opportunity to choose from three different courses of study to follow during their junior and senior years. The first career path is in Communications Media where they would study multimedia, computer graphics, creative writing, and publication. The second career path is the Performing Arts. Students would study music, theatre, and dance (if available). The third career path is the Visual Arts in which students would study art, photography, and design. Students in the A&C Academy, during their summers, have the opportunity to take college classes and take part in an internship.Health Sciences AcademyStudents in the Health Sciences Academy have an interest in a career in the health industry. They have strong science aptitude and a desire to work with and help other people. Their course of study will follow a similar route as the other academies during their freshman (FSA) and sophomore years. These students follow a rigorous science and math curriculum.At the end of their sophomore year, students in the Health Sciences Academy have two career paths to choose from in which their course of study during their junior and senior years will follow. The first career path is the Medical Services which would lead to further education and jobs in nursing, lab technicians, EMS, or pharmacy. The second career path students may choose from is Sports and Fitness Management. This path would lead to further education and jobs in sports and fitness management, or athletic training. Students in the Health Sciences Academy also have the opportunity to earn college credit and take part in internships during their summers. The Health Sciences Academy is sponsored by the Columbus Chamber of Commerce.Technology, Engineering, and Manufacturing Academy (TEAM)The Technology, Engineering, and Manufacturing (TEAM) Academy is for students who want to receive training and education preparing them for careers in designing new products and in the assembly of the products. Again, students follow a similar course of study during their freshman (FSA) and sophomore years as students in the other academies. Students should have strong aptitude in mathematics and computer science. They should enjoy working with their hands, understanding how things work, and designing things.As with the other academies, students can choose from three different career paths at the end of their sophomore year. The first career path is Electronic Engineering Technology in which students will learn the basics in electrical technology. This path would prepare students to work in the field of electronics or electrical technology. The second career path is Computer Aided Design Technology which would train the students in mechanical drafting, computer aided drafting (CAD), and basic manufacturing and mechanical principles. The third career path is Mechanical Engineering Technology which is similar to the other two paths with the addition of Machining, Hydraulics, and Robotics. The students in the TEAM Academy also have the opportunities to earn college credit, take part in summer internships, and have the promise of a job upon high school graduation. The TEAM Academy is sponsored by the Columbus Chamber of Commerce.The Freshman Success AcademyThe research will focus on the Freshman Success Academy (FSA). The FSA is a self-contained school-within-a-school organized around interdisciplinary teams of teachers designed to provide incoming freshman a smooth transition to high school. The rationale for the FSA is to improve student attendance, improve academic success, reduce the drop out rate, and instruction focused on career education. There are many components that are incorporated into a successful FSA.Teacher Buy-inIn order for the FSA to be successful, teachers must buy in to the collaborative effort. Teachers must be willing to work as a team to accomplish common goals. Oftentimes, teachers in the academy setting will be required to go above and beyond the contractual expectations of a teacher. General hiring and interview practices ensure that new members of the team do buy-in, but it is crucial for current staff members to cooperate with the team concept.Lead TeachersThe lead teacher of the academy plays an important role in the success of the academy. They communicate regularly with both school administration and district administration in order to ensure the academy is functioning and achieving itsexpectations. The lead teacher accomplishes this by attending all scheduled district-wide and school lead teacher/administrator meetings.The lead teacher of the academy provides necessary leadership within the academy. They clarify team goals and priorities. They facilitate the collection and team analysis of data. The lead teachers plan agendas, coordinate team meetings and documentation of activities. They coordinate all team activities and staff development for team members.Teacher CollaborationCollaboration amongst the team of teachers is a key part in the FSA. The team of teachers involved in the FSA work together very closely in standardizing the experience of the students in all of their classes. In order to facilitate this collaboration, the teachers share a common planning time in which they meet at least twice a week to coordinate their plans (Appendix C). The teachers have a common syllabus (Appendix A) that outlines common expectations, a common grading scale, the teaching philosophies and objectives of each course. There are ten core values that are posted in a visible and creative way in each classroom. These values are emphasized, taught, and adhered to in every classroom as what the behavioral expectations are. Several times throughout the school year the teachers map and integrate their curriculum. They plan cross-curricular projects and activities so that the students receive different academic perspectives on the same project or learning unit.Small Learning CommunitiesThe FSA is organized into small learning communities, called teams, in which students travel in groups to the same classes with the same team of teachers. The academy has a designated location within the building so the students spend the majority of the day in the same section of the school. The FSA is located primarily in the basement of the high school.Career ConnectionsEvery freshman within the academy takes an elective course called Career Connections. This course offers the students an overview of possible careers as well as different career development activities. The course is an introduction to the career focused education that is a key component in the academy model.Communication with ParentsCommunication with the parents is emphasized within the FSA. To open up this communication, teachers participate in home visits during the summer prior to the school year. During these visits, teachers share the student’s schedules, discuss values and expectations, and show a promotional video showcasing the FSA. The visits are effective in conveying the educational opportunity available to the student as well as openingcommunication between teachers and the parents. Throughout the school year, parents will receive a personal phone call twice a month from a teacher in the team (Appendix D). A record of these phone calls is kept in a phone log which records what was discussed in each conversation (Appendix J). At the beginning of the year, the parents are invited via phone to an Open House in which the parents are introduced to the entire staff, reminded of expectations, and served refreshments.The Importance of Academic AchievementThe curriculum of the FSA is college preparatory. One of the purposes of the FSA is to improve academic achievement of the students. There are several procedures in place to assist in accomplishing this purpose. First, there is a weekly grade check for the students where each teacher communicates the current grade the student has in that class. This occurs Monday or Tuesday of every week, and its purpose is for the students to have current and regular feedback in each of their classes. In order to regularly evaluate the progress of the freshman class as a whole, data is collected and evaluated on a weekly basis (Appendix E and F). The data includes attendance, parental contact, discipline, and the number of students with A’s or B’s and F’s. At the end of the first semester, students are called in with their parents for a conference with the team of teachers to review a credit check sheet. The credit check sheet (Appendix B) is a paper with all of the core courses and electives listed as well as the grades and credits earned by that student for the first semester. The teachers use this opportunity to explain the progress of the student so far, communicate areas of weakness where the student mayhave fallen behind, and remind them of the importance of being successful in all of their classes as a freshman. For instances where there are persistent behavioral, academic, or social problems, the team calls an intervention meeting. The parent’s attendance is requested by phone, and then teachers and oftentimes the social worker meet with the student. Strengths of the student are shared and discussed first, followed by a discussion of the problem(s) that persist. The student is given an opportunity to share any concerns that he/she might have, and then a plan is laid out to correct the current problem (Appendix K). A follow-up meeting is scheduled to discuss progress or the lack thereof in the specified area.Another important piece in the FSA regarding academic achievement is the free extra help that is available to all students. Math classes are double blocked throughout the year to make certain that all students receive the necessary instruction to catch them up if necessary and to ensure success in their future high school math courses. There also are available Career Based Intervention (math assistance) classes for those who come into high school lacking the basic math skills necessary to be successful in high school math. Also available to the students is after school tutoring in all of their core academic courses. Students may go as often as they need and stay as long as they need to guarantee that they understand and remain caught up in their studies.Attendance PolicyAttendance is a priority in the FSA. In order for students to achieve academically, they must be in school on a regular basis. This priority is emphasized in each of the core academic courses by making attendance a significant part of the grade received. The students receive ten points each day for being in class on time which accounts for 15 -20 percent of the overall grade in each class.Small Class SizeA priority of the FSA is to maintain small class sizes to ensure good individual attention for all of the students. The teacher to student ratio is 1:25 or smaller. This is also part of the smaller learning communities.Acceleration AcademyAcceleration Academy is an important piece of the reform model affecting student achievement. Acceleration Academy is an after hours “safety net” program designed to help students who have a difficult time adjusting to high school. Students can be assigned, with parental approval, to the Acceleration Academy if they strugglewith attendance, behavior, or academics in the traditional daytime high school classroom. The classes meet from 2:00 pm until 6:00 pm every day.The rationale for the Acceleration Academy is to reduce the number of distractions for the other students in the day program, and to provide the necessary skills for these students to be successful in the day program. This program provides an alternative environment with more extensive support services in order to increase opportunities for student achievement. As students experience success in this environment, the drop out rate is reduced.There are many components that make the Acceleration Academy unique and successful. Students will receive instruction in math, reading/language arts, and study skills. There is also tutoring for the Ohio Ninth Grade Proficiency Tests. The student to teacher ratio is no more than 1:15. Students are assigned for a mandatory minimum of one semester in which they can earn credits, and, if they are successful, they may return to the day program. Since the academy meets after school, transportation is provided to students who need it. If students return to the day program, they are monitored and mentored to ensure a successful return. It is possible for students to make up credits they have previously lost.Summer BridgeSummer Bridge is another “safety net” program designed to provide reading, math, and study skills to incoming freshman. The rationale for the program is to improve math and reading skills, improve study skills for the rigor of high school, and introduce students to post-secondary education and career opportunities.There are several important components that make up the Summer Bridge program. Math and reading acceleration are components that help to ensure future success in high school with these vital skills. Study skill techniques are also taught during Summer Bridge. Students receive extra opportunities to take the proficiency test if they attend this program. Students can attend at no cost to them or their parents, and they receive free transportation and free breakfast.Ohio Ninth Grade Proficiency TestsThe State of Ohio administers a ninth grade proficiency test in the areas of Reading, Writing, Citizenship, Mathematics, and Science. Students are required to pass all five parts of the proficiency test in order to graduate from high school. These tests are a priority within the FSA. The thinking is that if a freshman has passed all or most of the tests as a freshman then their probability of successfully graduating from high school increases dramatically. Therefore, a good amount of time is devoted to preparing the students for these proficiency tests. In the math classes, the math teachers organize thestudents based on whether or not they have passed the math proficiency test. The students that have not passed the test remain in the classroom and receive extensive instruction and preparation for the test. The students who have already passed the test (and do not have to take the test again) go to work on a hands-on project that is an extension of the classroom curriculum. These students have the opportunity to work on projects that the regular classroom and routine would not be able to facilitate like building balsa-wood bridges and working with graphing calculators. This makes it possible for the students who need the extra instruction in order to pass the proficiency test get it without boring the students who have already passed.Rewards and MotivationAnother important piece in the FSA is motivating students on to success and then recognizing them for success. There are many different ways in which students are motivated and rewarded for doing the right thing academically and behaviorally. In each class, teachers have tickets to give to students for doing something good (Appendix G). This may be something as simple as answering a difficult problem correctly, a random act of kindness, or doing an assigned task well. These tickets are stored in a ticket bin, and each week the teachers draw five names out of the bin. The students whose names were drawn receive the opportunity to choose a prize out of the prize drawer which is stocked with an assortment of prizes such as candy, candles, school supplies, make-up, school spirit items, etc. The teachers are responsible for keeping the prize drawer well stocked. All of the tickets not drawn that week then go into a separate bin that will bedrawn from at the award assemblies for much larger prizes such as sweatshirts, DVD players, boom boxes, etc.Awards AssembliesFour times per year, after each nine week grading period, award assemblies are held to honor student achievement (Appendix H). Once again, parents are invited over the phone to attend and see their child receive an award. At the assembly, awards are handed out recognizing achievement in the following categories: perfect attendance, outstanding scholar (honor roll), most improved student, outstanding student (exceptional academic and behavioral performance), and 110 percent (hardest worker award). Many students may receive a certificate for performance in each category, but then one student is voted as the overall winner in that category by the teachers. The winner receives a certificate, a reward (usually a sweatshirt, purse, or something similar), their picture on the school web-site, and their name on a plaque displayed in a trophy case in the hallway at school. Any student that earns a 4.0 (straight A’s in all subject areas) receives a t-shirt with their certificate. Throughout the award assembly, names are drawn from the ticket bin for various prizes. The last assembly of the year is a picnic at a park near the school. These assemblies are a celebration of student accomplishment that is enjoyed by parents and students alike.Honor Roll StudentsThere are special opportunities for students who make the honor roll for a nine- week grading period. First, they receive a certificate and recognition at the awards assembly (Appendix I). Secondly, a church in the surrounding neighborhood sponsors a free breakfast for the honor roll students in which they invite special speakers who are both community leaders and East High Alumni. Finally, they receive the opportunity to participate in the Honor Roll Sponsorship Program. This program allows each of the honor roll students to choose a fellow student who did not make the honor roll with whom to partner. If the honor roll student maintains his/her honor roll status while pulling their partner up onto the honor roll, then both students receives a free t-shirt and a pizza party. This program provides motivation for the students to stay on honor roll while helping a fellow student to achieve this status. Honor roll is a significant achievement, and it should be duly recognized and aspired to.Hand PrintsSuccess on the Ohio Ninth Grade Proficiency Test is a very important aspect in determining the success of the FSA. Therefore, when students achieve in this area by passing each part of the proficiency test, they are afforded the opportunity to be recognized for many years to come. For each area of the proficiency test in which the student passes, they place their handprint on the wall of the classroom that corresponds tothe section that they passed (for example, if they passed the math section, then they would place their handprint on the wall in their math classroom). The handprints will remain on the wall for all to see indefinitely.Cleveland TripTowards the end of the year, the entire FSA will be rewarded for their efforts with an all day trip to Cleveland. The staff and students travel to and from Cleveland in luxury charter buses. In Cleveland, they spend the morning touring a historical cemetery and an African-American museum. Then they board a luxury boat for a lunch cruise out onto Lake Erie. On the boat, the staff and students are treated to an all-you-can-eat buffet, music, and a DJ. There are academic assignments aligned with the trip, but it is primarily a reward for a great school year.Team T-ShirtsAs a way of building team pride within the FSA, each year team t-shirts are designed. Everyone (staff and students) are required to purchase one to wear to all of the award assemblies and the Cleveland trip. The t-shirts can be purchased in orange or black (school colors) and have “Property of East High” on the front and the motivational slogan for the year on back.Pilgrim MentoringMentoring programs are another opportunity promoting success in the lives of students. In the career academy, the students will receive mentoring from a business person, but in the FSA the students are required to become a mentor to an elementary age child who struggles with academics. Pilgrim Elementary School is a feeder school for East High School. The elementary school is in academic emergency. The FSA has instituted a mentoring program in which the ninth graders are paired up with a child in the first through sixth grade who is need of help. Each Monday afternoon, after school, the ninth graders walk down to Pilgrim Elementary School to spend 45 minutes working with a child who is assigned to them for the year. During this time, the child must spend twenty minutes reading out loud and writing sentences based on what they have read. The ninth graders then work with the children on any other school work their child needs to finish. The students have established many strong relationships with their child and are hopefully increasing their chance of success in the classroom. The freshman do receive community service hours in return which they need for graduation.The Research ProcessWhile there are several factors that may contribute to the achievement gap such as socio-economic status, lack of family/community support, poor school conditions, etc., the researcher will focus on the differences between the racial disparities. The researcherwill explain the overall program that has been implemented and analyze the results by making two separate comparisons. The comparisons will evaluate data that was gathered during two different academic years, 2000-01 (pre-academy) and 2002-2003 (fully- functional academy). The researcher will analyze data from these years to compare the results within the school to evaluate the academy’s effectiveness within the school as well as to compare the results with the white population within the State of Ohio to evaluate the academy’s effectiveness in narrowing the achievement gap between White and African-American students.Results within the SchoolThere are several important statistics that are analyzed to evaluate the success of the academy. The first data set that is evaluated is the attendance rate. During the 2000- 01 school year, the attendance rate for the freshman class was 73 percent, and, during the 2002-03 school year, the attendance rate increased to 86 percent.Results on the Ohio 9th Grade Proficiency Test improved in every subject area significantly between the 2000-01 and 2002-03 school years. There was continuous and consistent improvement in the rate of students who passed in all five sections of the proficiency test. The following chart demonstrates the progress of passing rates as the academy model was implemented into the school.Ohio 9th Grade Proficiency Test ScoresThese results represent students who were first year freshman at East High School during that school year. There is consistent improvement in all areas of the proficiency test after the implementation of the academy model.The failure rates decreased in all of the core academic subject areas during these same school years as the following chart demonstrates. The percentages represent the number of students taking the course that earned a failing grade and, therefore did not receive credit for this required course.Failure RatesThe decreasing number of failures, combined with the improved attendance rate and improved success on the proficiency tests, were a large factor in improving the matriculation rate. The matriculation rate for the Freshman Success Academy is defined as the number of students who received enough credits to make them legitimate sophomores at the end of their freshman year. The matriculation rate for East High School freshman improved from 52 percent at the end of the 2001-02 school year to 68 percent at the end of the 2002-03 school year.There were some other statistics that were indicative of the large number of students who succeeded in the F.S.A. atmosphere. There were 180 freshman enrolled in the F.S.A. Of those students, an average of 7 percent earned a 4.0 G.P.A. (straight A’s) each of the nine-week grading periods. An average of 15 percent earned at least a 3.5G.P.A. each nine-week grading period.  An average of 44 percent earned at least a 3.0each nine-week grading period which placed them on the school’s honor roll.\tThese numbers indicate that a large number of students thrived while enrolled in the F.S.A.Statistics Comparing East High School with the State of Ohio Disaggregated by RaceThe following statistics were generated through the Ohio Department of Education website. The website makes available data and a statistic-generating program called Microstrategy. This program contains data from the State of Ohio, Ohio’s schools, and school districts, and it allows generation of comparative statistics. The address for the website is www.ilrc.ode.state.oh.us/Microstrategy.Attendance Rates Results Disaggregated by RaceAttendance Rate – Building and District*East High School’s racial composition is almost 100% BlackAttendance Rate – State of OhioThe achievement gap is not obviously reflected in the attendance rates at the district and state level. There is a noticeable gap between students who attend East High School (almost exclusively African-American) and all the other White students in the State of Ohio. There is a significant decrease in this achievement gap during the time between the 2000-01 and the 2002-03 school years. The gap decreased from 16 percent during the 2000-01 school year to 7.9 percent during the 2002-03 school year. The increase in attendance at East High School may partially account for the increased academic achievement.Proficiency Results Disaggregated by RaceThe following chart shows the results of all five parts of the Ohio Ninth Grade Proficiency Tests for 2000-01 and 2002-03. It compares the freshman students attendingEast High School (comprised of almost all African-Americans) with both the Black and White students across the State of Ohio.The results indicate that gains were made over these years in decreasing the achievement gap between White and African-American students. As previously stated, the academy structure significantly improved the results in every area within the school. The results also indicate that the school made more progress in each area when compared to the other Black students in the State of Ohio. In fact, East High freshman had considerably more students pass each area of the proficiency test in 2002-03 except for the science section in 2002-03 than did all of the other Black students across the State of Ohio.It is necessary to examine the effect the academy structure at East High School had on the achievement gap between African-American and White students. The achievement gap decreased in every subject area of the Ohio Ninth Grade Proficiency Test. In fact, in the writing section the African-American students at East High School surpassed the number of White students passing this portion of the test. In Reading, the gap decreased from 25 percent in 2000-01 to 11 percent in 2002-03. In the Math section, the achievement gap lessened from 44 percent in 2000-01 to 24 percent in 2002-03. In the Citizenship portion of the test, the gap was decreased by half when it went from 32 percent in 2000-01 to 16 percent in 2002-03. Finally, in the science section, the gap, while it remains very large, did decrease from 48 percent in 2000-01 to 35 percent in 2002-03. The achievement gap between Black and White students was reduced, and in one section eliminated, in all areas of the Ohio Ninth Grade Proficiency Test at East High School.Significance of the ResultsThese results were significant in demonstrating the effectiveness of the academy structure in reducing the achievement gap between African-American and White students. The major change that occurred at East High School between the two years being compared was the implementation and the functionality of the Freshman Success Academy.Chapter 4: Perspectives, Conclusions, and RecommendationsThere are five different groups of people affected by the academy model: the teachers, the school administrators, the parents, the students, and the researchers. Perspectives and conclusions from each group will be disclosed.Perspectives and Conclusions of the TeachersThe Teacher Questionnaire (Appendix L) was given to seven public school teachers who were directly involved with the Freshman Success Academy at East High School. The teachers who shared their responses have been teaching for the following number of years: 30, 1, 1, 6, 15, 32, and 7. There were two teachers that indicated they have 6 years experience in an academy setting, and the rest had 3 years experience in the academy structure. Their responses will be shared.Question: “What are the positive aspects, if any, of teaching in an academy?”The teacher all related how the community of teachers with shared expectations and students allows cross-referencing and cohesiveness with one another. It allows teachers to be unified in dealing with achievement and discipline issues. The common planning time is important to allow time to discuss concerns. The teachers indicated they learn much more about their students in an academy setting. They said students having the same teachers and traveling from class to class with the same group of fellow studentsis a positive aspect. Having common goals helps to unify the teachers. Support is natural when the expectations are the same. Another positive aspect mentioned is the relationships developed with the other teachers that are in the academy.Question: “What are the negative aspects, if any, of teaching in an academy?”Many of the teachers indicated that the negative aspects related to time issues. Meetings absorb a large amount of the teachers planning time throughout the week. Phone calls every two weeks to a different group of parents can also take up time. The other issue that seemed to resonate among several of the teachers was that of interpersonal relationships among the team members. It takes a large amount of cooperation, flexibility, and good communication in order for the team of teachers to function together cohesively. If a teacher is assigned to this teaching position and does not buy in to the concept, they will have a hard time working in the team structure. There also was mentioned a concern that the older, veteran teachers’ opinions are not considered and valued as much as some of the younger team members.Question: “How does the academy structure affect student attendance and achievement?”The teachers stressed the importance of the common planning time in order to accomplish several goals. Attendance can be checked between teachers on a daily basis to see which students are attending some classes but skipping others. The time togetherenables teachers to have a stronger more unified message to the students. The common planning time is also used to bring in parents of students who are struggling academically or behaviorally and meet with all the teachers at once. The students understand that the teachers communicate regularly and that if there is a problem there will be a parent conference either by phone or in person. Another reason for the increased attendance is the positive relationships that are formed between the students and the teachers. Some teachers mentioned that while some progress has been made in the area of attendance, more work can still be done across the board to improve this area. Higher achievement is encouraged through the positive rewards recognizing the achievement.Question: “What advice do you have for other teachers working in an academy structure?”Buying into the concept completely and communicating clearly are the two points of emphasis expressed by the teachers. If a teacher does not buy in to or agree with the concept of the academy structure, they will become problematic. It is important to be a team player and do your part in helping the academy to be successful. Do not be afraid to speak up and share ideas. When ideas are communicated, it is important to value all input from every team member. Patience is an important attribute when working with other people. Communicate, communicate, communicate and work, work, work, were also included in the comments. Administrative support is a necessary ingredient for a successful academy.Question: “What conclusions have you drawn in regards to the academy structure at East High School?”The additional support provided to the freshman is crucial in making the transition into high school. It only works well if the teachers buy into the cooperative work structure of the academy. It is the best solution for a very difficult environment. The goals are accomplished much easier with a unified team working towards them, but differences in expectations can cause problems in reaching a consensus. Beware of old vs. young sentiments or any other issues that can divide rather than unify the team. The 4X4 block schedule helps bring academic success to the urban setting.Perspectives and Conclusions of the School AdministratorsThe school administrator questionnaire (Appendix M) was given to two public school administrators who are directly involved in the Freshman Success Academy at East High School. They are the principal of the school who has been an administrator for 22 years, 15 in an academy school and 7 in non-academy schools, and the assistant principal responsible for the freshman who has 13 years, 7 of those years in an academy school, of school administration experience.Question: “What are the critical components that must be in place within a school in order for the academy structure to be successful?”Common planning time for core academic teachers in every academy is essential.A schedule that works and is true to the academy model.A committed teaching staff is essential for success.\tTeacher buy-in and commitment.Support from the business community.Support from higher education.Work based learning.Mentoring program.Question: “What are the positive aspects, if any, of the academy structure in a school?”The relationships promoted in the academy structure seems to be the center of many of the positive aspects relating to this model. They include small learning communities with a common core of caring teachers. In these communities, the teachers and students can work together with a common goal. There is a practical focus for the staff and students. Mentoring, internships, and college opportunities in a chosen field while the students are still in high school are all positive parts of the academy model. Also, there is real career exploration that takes place naturally within the application of the academies.Question: “What are the negative aspects, if any, of the academy structure in a school?”The scheduling is much more complicated than the traditional school schedule. Non-cooperative team members can also end up being a negative aspect in the academy. The principal replied that there are no negative aspects associated with the academy model.Question: “In your experience, how does the academy structure affect the attendance and achievement of the students?”The teacher/student/parent relationship enhanced in the academy structure positively affects the attendance rate. There is a feeling of “togetherness” that is promoted. So, when the academy model is implemented correctly, attendance and achievement will significantly improve.Question: “What are your concluding thoughts with regard to the academy school structure?”This is the only way to go in a large urban school. If students feel welcomed and engaged both academically and socially, they have a much greater chance of being successful.“When implemented correctly, it is a way of providing students a supportive environment that allows them to bridge the gap between school and the working world. It allows for the practical application of the academies in a nurturing, caring environment.”Perspectives and Conclusions of StudentsTen students who had completed the Freshman Success Academy during the 2002-03 school year were chosen to receive and fill out the student questionnaire (Appendix O). They were also given a copy of the parent survey for their parents to fill out. They were promised a pizza party at lunch if they returned the questionnaires by a certain time. 8 of the 10 questionnaires were completed. The students included six boys and two girls. Their responses are summarized and shared here.Question: “Describe what things you liked, if any, about the Freshman Success Academy?”There were several different things that the students mentioned liking in the Freshmen Success Academy. They enjoyed the strong relationships that they developed with their freshman teachers. They liked the fact that if they did not understand something academically, there was always extra help available. They felt the teachers “broke things down” and made them easier to understand. Learning was more fun, and they learned more than they have ever learned before. The students also expressed thatthey could get help with things other than just academic issues – life issues. They really liked the Cleveland trip, the projects, the end of the year picnic, and the awards assemblies.Question: “Describe what things you did not like, if any, about the Freshman Success Academy?”One student expressed that at times he did not like the added attention he received. He said, “they are always on your back.” Another student mentioned specific teachers they did not like or with whom they did not get along. Yet another student expressed they did not like the other students who did not want to learn or do the work. And several students said they liked everything about the Freshman Success Academy.Question: “Do you feel that the Freshman Success Academy prepared you to be successful in high school? Explain.”Only one student responded no to this question. She said that the work was too easy, and that they weren’t given the opportunity to work on their own like they have to as sophomores. The other seven students responded with yeses for various reasons. One student said that the academy allowed the majority of the freshman to mature and become respectful of teachers. Another student said the teachers explained everything that goes on in high school and the importance of their grades in the college process very well.Another student made reference to the extra help available when he had trouble understanding. Several of the students simply said they learned a lot.Question: “What would you change, if anything, about the Freshman Success Academy?”One student replied that she would let the freshman students work more independently. Another student wanted to change the t-shirts. The other six students said that they would not change anything.Perspectives and Conclusions of ParentsThe parent questionnaire (Appendix N) was delivered to each parent by their child who was also filling out the student questionnaire. Therefore, I received back eight parent questionnaires which contained four questions each. The first three questions the parent simply had to circle a response out of the following choices: I strongly agree, I agree, I disagree, or undecided. The fourth question allowed them to share any comments they had regarding the Freshman Success Academy. Their responses are shared.Question: “Did you feel as if you were regularly contacted regarding your child’s progress?”For this question, there were six parents who circled “I strongly agree,” one parent who circled “I agree,” and one parent who circled “I disagree.”Question: “Did you feel more involved in your child’s education?”On this question, there were five parents who circle “I strongly agree,” two parents who circled “I agree,” and one parent who circled “I disagree.”Question: “Did you think your child’s academic achievement improved in the Freshman Success Academy?”For this question, there were three parents that circled “I strongly agree,” four parents that circled “I agree,” and again one parent that circled “I disagree.”Question: “Do you have any comments regarding your child’s experience in the Freshman Success Academy?”One parent had a few negative comments questioning the amount of contact he received from the teachers at regular intervals. He said that he would like earlier notification if his son is not performing well in a class. He also questioned how students were assigned to particular classes. Two parents commented on the great teachers in the Freshman Success Academy. The other five parents did not make any comments.Perspectives and Conclusions from ResearchersThe past year and a half of researching both the achievement gap existing between African-American and White students and possible solutions for this gap has been encouraging, challenging, and enlightening. As a teacher of African-American students, the researcher was challenged on a daily basis by the achievement gap. The researcher was forced to evaluate why his students achieved at a lower level and what he could do to improve achievement in his classroom. The findings, especially relating to the academy structure, were encouraging in the results achieved.The researcher became involved in teaching in the Freshman Success Academy at East High School at the beginning of the 2002-03 school year. He had taught at East High School for one year previous to this experience and had a total of eight years of teaching experience.In an urban setting, it is critical for schools to organize and structure themselves such that the students feel welcomed and have a sense of belonging. The majority of students come into school with many life issues that make learning more difficult.Therefore, it is imperative for schools to have a strategy for creating a safe and loving environment for the students. This makes the concept and model of smaller schools within a school (academy) a logical strategy for fulfilling this strategy. In order for this model to be successful, there must be some components in place within the school.Administrative support is a critical component in implementing a successful academy. Scheduling is more complex to ensure that there is a common planning period for all of the teachers within the academy. As the teachers come up with creative ideas and integrative learning projects, the administration must be willing to work with changes in the schedule and other issues that may arise. They must be willing to allow the caring group of teachers to become creative in their teaching strategies. The administration must recognize the priority that the freshman year is in helping students to transition into high school and propelling them on to future success.The teachers who teach in the academy are the key to forming and running a successful academy. Teachers must buy into the team concept completely and be willing to communicate and work closely with the other members of the team. They must truly care for the students they are entrusted to teach. They must be willing to work above and beyond what the contract requires for the benefit of the students. They must be willing to spend extra time contacting parents and increasing their involvement. The teachers must be committed to creating an environment where the students feel safe, loved, and accepted and still emphasizing the importance of learning. Without teachers who are committed to these things, the academy will not function any better than a traditional school.The vast majority of students with regular attendance in the Freshman Success Academy experienced academic and social success. Across the board amongst the freshman, academic achievement increased. This was reflected in the increasedattendance rate, increased number of students on the honor roll each nine weeks, and increased proficiency test scores. The students received constant reminders of what appropriate behavior and communication looked like in the classroom setting. The expectations and consequences for inappropriate behavior were clearly explained on a regular basis. As a result, discipline problems occurred less frequently.The researcher has concluded that educators need to address the issue of the achievement gap between African-American and White students by working to find things that schools can do to raise the achievement of all students regardless of race. Educators must evaluate the staff, policies, and procedures of their schools to see if changes are necessary in order to increase achievement. A specific plan must be formulated for each school and steps must be taken to implement and fulfill this plan. The implementation process must be evaluated and tweaked on a regular basis to make sure that the achievement of students remains the priority through each phase of reform. Staff who are not committed to this priority must be moved on if possible. Our goal as educators should be that there is truly no child left behind.Appendix ACourse Title Expectations and SyllabusTeacher’s name Room #Course Description: Describe the purpose of your class.

All team members are expected to attend all meetings.There may be a need to have an additional meeting day, but very seldom.Data will be turned in at the beginning of each Tuesday’s meetings. We will rotate duties of taking notes at all meetings. These notes will accompany the data that is turned into the central office.These meetings will cover all team issues, conduct student contract meetings and plan events. Please plan on approximately one hour for each meeting. Occasionally, we will have guest speakers and/or administration help us become more of a “team”.Appendix DPHONE CALLS ANDPARENTAL INVOLVEMENTThe East High School Freshman Success Academy will repeatedly attempt to meet and involve each parent. We believe that strong parent involvement is key to student achievement, appropriate behavior and the overall success of our students and ultimately our program.Teachers will be required to reach each parent (not an answering machine) of a designated group of students every two weeks.These phone calls and/or home visits will be documented and a component of our data collection process and turned in weekly.The content of these phone calls will be determined by individual teachers and any team events held. The initial phone call must only contain positive feedback and introductory comments. Please see administration if you need support on negative behavior prior to your first call. Or, hurry and get all calls in prior to any difficulties!Appendix EDATA COLLECTIONThe East High School Freshman Success Academy Teachers will have to collect data for each student each week. Teachers will need to keep accurate attendance records, grade updates, document parent phone calls, track conferences (with students and/or parents), list proficiency areas passed, and record students removed from the learning environment.This data will need to be reported to the lead teacher at the beginning of Tuesday’s team meeting. Data collection will be a necessary component in evaluating our successes as well as our students. We will have a building data coordinator that may also request additional information and assist us interpreting the information.Data collection is not simply “busy work” but will enable our academy to identify both strengths and weaknesses for continued improvement.Appendix FData Collection SheetMeeting Date\t\tTeacher\tTeam\tA\tor\tBConcerns:Appendix GTICKET INCENTIVE PROGRAMThe East High School Freshman Success Academy will employ a ticket incentive program. Each teacher will be given tickets weekly that may be given out as deemed necessary. Please give out all tickets weekly.Students are responsible for writing their name on the ticket and placing it in the can in Ms Heideman’s room #2 (for team A) and Ms. Luaces’s room #29 (for team B). Team members will draw weekly winners at team meetings.Winners will be announced in classes and allowed to choose one item from the prize drawer. Teachers will be responsible for helping their respective teams stock the prize drawer with various items.Appendix HASSEMBLIESThe East High School Freshman Success Academy is committed to honoring students and acknowledging accomplishments and marked improvement (no matter how small it may be ). Each nine weeks, teachers will nominate students in the following areas:110% effort Most improvedPerfect attendanceScholar (this is done with GPA) Outstanding student (not just GPA)Each nomination will be called to the stage and receive a certificate and a small award. This usually consists of a free food coupon. Each category will also have a winner that will receive a certificate, their name displayed in a plaque, a star student t- shirt and a prize. The prizes will hopefully be donated and can range from a backpack to a CD walkman.Teachers will need to nominate and vote on each category. Teachers also will help complete certificates and participate in each assembly. The 2nd and 4th assemblies will also include students being rewarded for each individual area they pass on proficiency.These assemblies not only honor students and raise self- esteem, they teach appropriate behavior and connect with parents in a positive manner. Hopefully, we can feature a guest feature at each assembly also.Teachers will need to help request donated items for each assembly to defer costs. Parents will also be notified about each assembly.Appendix IFollow Me To Honor Roll CertificateHONOR ROLL STUDENT:Follow Me To Honor RollI WOULD LIKE TO SPONSOR A FELLOW FRESHMANSTUDENT TO JOIN ME ON THE HONOR ROLL FOR THE SECOND GRADING PERIOD.SPONSORED STUDENT:INITIALS OF ACCEPTANCE:I WILL REMAIN ON THE HONOR ROLL AND WILL PULL A CLASSMATE ON WITH ME.Follow Me To Honor RollHONOR ROLL STUDENT:I WOULD LIKE TO SPONSOR A FELLOW FRESHMANSTUDENT TO JOIN ME ON THE HONOR ROLL FOR THE SECOND GRADING PERIOD.SPONSORED STUDENT:INITIALS OF ACCEPTANCE:I WILL REMAIN ON THE HONOR ROLL AND WILL PULL A CLASSMATE ON WITH ME.Appendix JPhone Log SheetFreshman Success Academy Phone LogStudent Name\t\t\t\tTeam A or B Phone #\t\tAlternate #\t\tContact Person\t Best Time to Call\tSections of the Proficiency Passed (check all that apply): W  R  M  C  S Teacher:\tDate:\tPerson spoken to:\tTopics discussed:Appendix KFreshman Academy Student Success ContractStudent’s Name:\t Date:\t Scheduled Review Date:\tStudent’s Strengths: 1)\t\t3)\t2)\t\t4)\tSignatures:\t\t\tAppendix LTeacher QuestionnaireThank you for sharing your time with me.

and m inority students the gap is evident in test scores , graduation rates , and appear s across the curriculum it was narrow ing through the decades of the 70 s and 80 s , but , in the 1990 s , the gap has widened som ewhat by the end of high school , in fact , african am erican and latino students have skills in both reading and mathem atics that are th e sam e as those of white s tudents in the 8th grade ( haycock , 2001 ) according to the ohio de partm ent of education , the data showing 6th graders who m et the m inimum state perform ance standards in read ing and m athematics proficiency testing for 2000 01 revealed the gl aring disparity a mongst racial groups in the m athematics section , 68 4 percent of white students m et the standard com pared to 25 8 percent of african am erican students in reading , 65 3 perc ent of white students met the standard com pared to 25 0 percen t of african am erican stu dents ( gehring , 2002 ) sat scores revealed the continued in equality into the high school age as the average scores for white students on the verbal and m ath portions were 506 and 514 respectively in 2001 , whereas african am erican students scored an average of 433 and 426 respectively ( roach , 2001 ) th e academ ic achievem ent gap between white stud ents and m inorities , particularly african americans , is well docum ented 1 this data c alls the researche r to question why this achiev ement gap exists and persists there appears to be several factors that play a role in establishing the gap some of the factors are stude nt related like poverty , fam ily and community support , and negative peer pressure ( alson , 2003 ) there are also many factors that involve the school s responsibility for the gap which include high standards , a challenging curriculum , extra help for studen ts , teacher quality , and in structional qu ality the focus of this paper will be the s chool s role in elim inatin g or at leas t narrowing the gap purpose the purpose of the research is to ex amine the achievem ent gap between w hite students and african am erican students and to evaluate a specific school structure s effectivenes s in narrowing the g ap the res earcher will an swer the qu estion does the academ y ( school within a school ) structur e significantly reduce the achievem ent gap between af rican am erican and w hite stud ents ? the rese arch will expla in the educational challenges facing the african am erican student and describe som e school related solutions for raising the achievem ent of these students the challen ges pres ented in narrowing th e achievem ent gap and raising equity for all students must be confronted by schools there is m uch work to be done and several key issues need to be addressed to im prove the quality of educatio n at all sch ools teacher and instru ctional quality m ust be a priority especially in high m inority school settings where the achievem ent gap is prevalen t schools with the m ost needs tend to not retain effective teachers and adm inistrato rs this affects the qua lity of instruction 2presented and facilitates an increasing ach ievem ent gap between white and m inority students com prehensive school refor m is necessary in m any cases so that sch ools get organized in their approaches to counter acting the gap th reform makes possible changes needed in what is taught , how it is taught , and how it is assessed on a school wide instead of class by class level ( c odding , 2000 ) comprehensive school refor m affects all aspects at all lev els of a school including leadership , m anagem ent , organization , clim ate , use of m oney , and use of hum an resources there are m any models for com prehensive school refor m , but this research will focus o n the acad emy ( school within a school ) stru cture and its effectiveness in narrowing the achievem ent gap methodology in order to answer the que stion of the efficiency of various school structures , specifically the academ y model , in im proving the achievement gap , the paper will begin with an in depth look at the va rious literature wri tten on the topic of the achievem ent gap it attem pts to read and assim ilate the views a nd infor mation out there re garding this topic it will a lso attem pt to identif y poss ible c auses and solution s for the achievem ent gap the author accessed most of the previous ly conducted research through the eri c databas e , academ ic search prem ier , cu rrent journals , and the w orld w ide w eb 3the m ethod of research will involve a co rrelative exam ination of two ninth grad e classes at an urban high school whose dem ographic m akeup consists of approxim ately 99 percen t african am erican students the classes will be evalua ted in term s of state proficiency testing , acad emic achievem ent , and attend ance the first class evaluated will be the freshm an class during the 19 99 2000 school year who were a tradition al fres hman class

understand the breadth of the problem as well as m any of the factors playing a role in the achievem ent gap the reader will be presented with many of the issues needing to be addressed by schools in the effort to reach all students an d rais e ach ievem ent the current acade my school structure will be evalu ated as to whether or not it is a viable vehicle of com prehensive school reform in raising the achievem ent of african am erican students to a level m ore closely paralleling that of w hite students 6chapter 2 literature review significan ce for decades researchers have discu ssed an d debated the lower levels of educational achievem ent of african am erican com pared with w hite studen ts this achievem ent gap exists in all school ages ev en when students arrive at kindergarten , the african american stud ents are con siderab ly behind th eir white peers in m easurable cognitive sk ills ( nettles , 2003 , p 215 ) there is an endless lis t of possible reasons for this racial d ivide in ach ievem ent levels ranging from the following linguist ic incongruities between hom e and school culture differing levels of pare ntal involvem ent lack of cultu ral and social capital lower general socio econom ic status divergent study ha bits and motivational levels the fear of acting white lower teacher e xpectations , and the quantity a nd quality of m aterial they are exposed to ( nettles , 2003 , p 216 ) statistics regarding the exis tence of an achievement gap between 1970 and 1988 , the achievem ent gap between african am erican and white students declined conti nuously until it was cut by fift y percent then , throughout the 1990 s , the achievement gap began to wide n again to explain this widening of the gap , it is necessary to closely exam ine what is going on ( haycock , 2001 , p 6 ) 7 there are several achievem ent patterns wh ich are worthy of noting in 1999 , 1 in 100 african am erican 17 year olds can read an d gather inf ormation fr om a specialized text ( such as a science article in a m agazine ) com pared to 1 in 12 white students 1 in 100 african am erican students can comfortabl y solve m ulti step problem s compared to about 1 in 10 w hite students the ratio of african am erican students to w hite students who are able to com pute fractions , solve p ercents , and calcu late averages was 30 percent to 70 percent in the 18 24 age group , 90 percent of w hites have either com pleted high school or earned a ged while the percenta ge of african am ericans drops to 81 approxim ately 76 percent of w hite high school gr aduates go directly to college , while 71 percen t of african am ericans will g o african americans are only half as likely to earn a bachelors degree by the ag e of 29 as wh ites the se sta tistics do indicate an achievem ent gap trend between races ( haycock , 2001 , p 7 ) achievement gap statistics for ohio schools in ohio , the statistics are just as alarm ing for exam ple , i n 7th grade , only 11 percen t of african americ an students passed all five parts of the states new proficiency test , com pared with 43 percen t of white st udents in 2001 , only 59 percent of african american students graduated from high schoo l , com pared with 85 percent of whit e students data released com paring sixth graders were as follows stud ents p assing the math proficiency test 68 4 percent of white students and 25 8 percent of african 8american students and student s passing the reading profic iency test 65 3 percent of white students and 25 0 percent of african am erican students ( gehring , 2002 , pp 20 21 ) also in ohio , 79 percent of white 9th graders perform ed at or above the passing rate f or the ohio 9th grade math proficiency t est , com pared to only 38 percen t of the african americ an 9th graders th is m eans that 62 percent of african am erican 9th graders in ohio are not passing , com pared to only 21 percent of white 9th graders according to the 2000 national assessm ent of educational progress ( naep ) , ohio s african american w hite achievem ent gap falls 11th among all of the states this puts ohio in the top quartile am ong states on the naep m ath assessm ent ( the education trust , 2003 ) the achievem ent gap is also apparent in the num ber of st udents successfully taking advanced placem ent ( ap ) courses and the end of the year exams in 2000 2001 , of the students taking ap exa ms in ohio , 4 percen t of the test takers were african american and 89 percent of them were w hite on the calculus ab exam of the students taking the exam , 31 per cent of the african ame rican students earned scores of 3 , 4 , or 5 ( passing scores ) , com pared to 69 percen t of white stu dents on the ap english language and com position exam , 5 percen t of the tes t takers were african american and 90 percent were white , and , of those who took this exam , the num ber of passers was similar 31 percent african american and 68 percent w hite finally , in the ap biology course , 4 percent of the course takers were african am erican and 85 percent were white 9the num ber of students passing the exa m was as follows 15 percent of the african american students and 57 percent of the wh ite students passed ( the education t rust , 2003 ) data gather ed from the sat college achiev ement test also indic ated a gap between african am erican and w hite high school seniors on the m ath portion of the test , the average score in 2001 for white stude nts taking the test was 531 com pared to an average score of 426 for african am erican stud ents the gap is obvious in the average verbal scores as well white students earne d a 52 9 while african am ericans earned a 433 average score college board president gast on caperton responded to this data saying , the score gaps for different racial , ethnic , and socioeconom ic groups that we see on the sat also appear on virtually every m easure of achievem ent , including other standardized tests and classroom grades , and they show up as early as fourth grad e these differences are a powerful illustration of a persistent social problem in our country inequitable access to hig h quality ed ucation ( roach , 2001 , p 12 ) according to two intern ationa l surveys , the trends in inte rnationa l ma them atics and science study ( timss ) and the program for international student assessm ent ( pisa ) , the gap between low achievers and av erage students persist internationally the gap does not seem to be dependent upon the wealth and prosperity of the country wealthier countries such as po rtugal , italy , and the united states have a m uch higher achievem ent gap than m any poorer countries su ch as south korea the study notes that 10student achievem ent seem s to be closely lin ked to the students family backgrounds ( borja , 2002 , p 10 ) data indic ates the ach ievement gap is accom panied by a te acher gap quality counts 2003 is a report , compiled by richard ingersoll of th e university of pennsylvania , analyzing p ublic school students access to qualified teachers the data reveals 32 percent of high school students in high poverty schools take a class w ith a teacher that did not even minor in th e subject th at he or she teaches , co mpared to only 22 p ercent in low poverty schools t his percentage increas es to m ore than 50 percent in the m iddle school grades in high poverty schools , com pared to 44 per cent in low poverty schools 70 percent of students in low poverty second ary schools have teachers who have both majored in and becom e licensed in the subjec ts they teach , compared to about 50 percent of high poverty schools fina lly , students in high poverty sc hools are more likely to be taught by less experien ced teachers less th an 9 percent of teachers in low poverty schools hav e fewer than 3 years of teaching experience , whereas m ore than 13 percent of teachers in h igh poverty schools hav e little te aching experien ce ( heim el , 2003 , p 18 ) the issue of white flight to non public schools and its affect on public schools is a possible concern which m ay be affecting achievem ent in certain school settings after several statistical analys es , there doe s seem to be a correlatio n between the percentage of white students enrolled in non public school s and the concentration of minorities in the pub lic schools secondly , wh ite enro llment does make a d ifference in 11the public schools the black white gap is greater in districts with m any whites in non public schools ( bankston , caldas , 2000 , pp 539 550 ) analysis of the statistics historically , african am erican youth have been thought to have done better if they adop ted a eurocen tric cultural value sy stem in order for them to achieve , they had to act white the findings of this study we re these students s howed high self esteem and achievem ent goals in conjunction with af ro centric ity the findings revealed that when achievem ent test scores were the m easure of perform ance , the low scores were associated with the eu rocentric racial attitudes on the contrary , high self esteem and achievem ent goals were associated with an af ro centric view of self ( spencer , 2001 , pp 21 30 ) a study was com pleted that m easur ed the gap between ethnic groups by assessing data on the national assessm ent of educational progress ( naep ) and sat results it of fered an in de pth look at the available data on the black w hite and hispanic white gap in the areas of reading and m athematics it sought to answer the question as to why the gap seem ed to decrease in the 1970 s and early 1980 s but then appeared to widen again in the 1990 s the study addre sses m any factors percei ved as reasons for these pheno mena such as changes in socio econom ic and fam ily conditions , changes in youth culture and student beha viors , and changes in school ing conditions and practices the study concludes that m uch ground overall has been covered in narrowing the racial and ethnic gap over the last three decades it appears that m any of the gains m ade during 12the firs t two decades o ccurred at the basic sk ills level and th en the gap grew again w hen the em phasis shifted toward the advanced skills level during the 1980 s the study states that the factors that hav e been attributed to the gap do not easily exp lain the current widening of the g ap and that f urther resea rch is n ecessa ry ac ross multiple fields of study ( lee , 2002 , pp 3 12 ) another stu dy attem pted to id entify if after school activities affected ach ievem ent of 8th and 10th grade students and students of differe nt ethnicity they looked at the two opposing views on the subject zero sum concep t ( extra activities just take tim e away from students that they should use to study ) an d the view that these activities provide an experience that con tributes to the overall developm ent of the student the study used the national education longitudinal study ( nels 1988 ) and it included 8th and 10th grade students whose data on the test were com plete the study evaluated the students scores in several content areas and catego rized th e stu dents pu rsuits on th e basis of in or out of school , acad emic or nonacadem ic , and organi zed or nonorganized the study concluded that academ ic pursuits seem ed to be cons istently related to achievem ent , while nonacadem ic pursuits were not s ignificantly re lated to achievem ent these results indicated that the a ffect was different am ong differing et hnicities , but it did not go into any depth with this observati on ( schreiber , 2002 , pp 10 100 ) another stu dy com pares the edu cational e xpectations of parent s and the influence these expectations hav e on students of differe nt races the authors d ifferentiate between the whites and the african am erican hispan ic in that the expecta tions are gene rally 13higher the exception to this is the african a merican father due to th e lack of a fathe r figure in most cases the conclu sion was as follo ws as we have shown , the aspirations of close relatives and pa rents , but not those of teachers and p eers , hav e differential effects on students educational expectations , poin ting to the importance of exam ining the unique fam ily and social contexts in which students of different rac es live in americ a ( cheng , 2002 , pp 306 327 ) in another study , evidence is describe d which shows achievem ent gaps in mathematics between black and w hite students the study also exam ined how the socio econom ic status ( ses ) of the students affects th e gap it found ses had little affect in the disparity of achievem ent levels the gap ha d narrowed for nearly two decades during the 1970 s and the 1980 s , but started widening ag ain during the 1990 s the researcher evaluated the differences in instructiona l practices in prim arily white and black class rooms the research id entified som e key differences in in structional belief and practices b etween teach ers of w hite and bl ack students teachers of white stud ents focused m ore on reasoning skills and problem solving , whereas teachers of black students focused on single solution and dr ill based instruc tiona l stra tegies there were also discrepancies found in student course taking and beliefs between these two groups the study concluded there are disp arities between black and white students achievem ent , and this is regardless of thei r ses status ( lubienski , 2002 , pp 269 287 ) another study took a quantitative approach to show evidence that , for black and white students , environm ent ( ame rican vs foreign born ) plays a decisive role in 14determ ining their su ccess in p recalculus they showed the prepara tion in la ter skills ( the m ath skills most necessa ry for succe ss in advanced math courses ) was furthe r achieved by those who were foreign born the study involved a sam ple from a public university in new york with 2 , 005 students who were broken down by gender , ethnicity , age , and birthplace the instrum ent used wa s a ceeb elem entary algebra skills test the study to ok place at a four year colleg e th ey then com pared th e scores ach ieved on the test to the grade p erformance in precalculus the conclusion was that foreign born students were better p repared than a merican whites , blacks , and hispan ics in the l ater skills th erefore , the results point to the environm ent playing a decis ive role in the developm ent of later skills and , thus , subse quent succ ess in pre calculus ( ba ranchik , 2002 , pp 253 267 ) even long after the 1954 u s suprem e court decision in brown v board of education , segregated schools continue due to a combination of continued residential segregation and the tradition of neighborhood school assignm ent over 67 percent of african american students attend m ajority m inority schools and 33 percent attend schools with m ore than 90 percent m inority enrollm ent on the other hand , over 90 percent of white students attend school in white majority districts this has led to serious negative ram ification s for most afri can am erican students major ity m inority school districts have a more difficult tim e attracting and reta ining qualified teachers oftentim es students are not offered access to advanced coursework and inform ation about colleg e entrance requirem ents ( nettles , 200 3 , pp 218 219 ) 15 what students say th ink ab out the achievement gap the way students think and feel is im portant to consider in order to close the achievem ent gap in m ath and science , we m ust first give stud ents the con fidence and the opportunities to succeed course s should be offered to prepar e students for standardized tests , and the im portance of th ese tests should be em phasized to m inority and low income students p arent s help and involvem ent should be solicited as part of their child s education schools should provide summ er bridge learning opportunities and m entor program s to link student s educational experien ces to the world of work students should be provid ed with every p ossible reso urce and opportunity to help th em achieve acad emic success ( hrabowski , 2003 , pp 44 48 ) good teaching is extrem ely i mportan t and has been shown to impact the achievem ent of students a study evaluated te achers through the eyes of students in an urban school setting t he stude nts interviewed spoke of go od teachers who held high expecta tions for them and held the m to th at high standard the students stressed the importance of good teaching that results in learning the st udents also spoke favorably of the block schedule claim ing they learned b etter becau se the schedu le forced teach ers to becom e better at teach ing stu dents sim ply wanted good teachers because such teachers m ade them learn often in spite of them selves ( corbett , 2002 , p p 18 22 ) 16oftentim es , m inority students are not aw are of the perception their school and race ach ieves far belo w the stand ard w hen the data w as revealed to students in a philadelphia inner city school , the students gave the following prim ary responses as reasons for the lower scores 31 percent indicated the students held them selves responsib le , 24 percen t referred to teacher b ehavior , 18 percent ind icated their parents role , 13 percent discussed the schools them selves , and 11 percent referred to the students environm ent or comm unity they also incl uded poverty and peer pressure in their responses the studen ts described teacher s as unsupportiv e th ey just hand ou t the work and expect us to do it withou t doing m uch teach ing the students wanted their parents to take a m ore activ e role in being inv olved in the ir educ ation the stud ents wanted schools to hold them to higher expe ctations and provide curriculum that was challenging many of the stude nts felt trapped in the ir home environm ent , and they felt that if they tried to im prove the ir performance then they would be perceived as acting white co mmunities and schools must com e together , d ecide what th ey value for young people , and support that with all of their effort ( taylor , 2003 , pp 72 75 ) identify ing the causes for the gap society and adults tend to claim the reasons for the achi evement gap between races can be traced back to things outside of the school s con trol , such as , lack of fa milial support , low socio econom ic status , and lack of adequate basic needs ( food , clothing , etc ) students tend to comm unicate som e different sources for the gap , such as , poorly prepared teachers , low expectations , and bor ing , non challenging curr iculum as bigger 17reasons for the achievement gap the data seem s to support what the students are saying it shows that education takes the students w ho begin with less and system atically give them less in the schools this does not dim inish the role outside influences play in the education of studen ts , bu t , rather , it says th at wha t schoo ls do matters g reatly in the lives and education of these disadvantaged students ( haycock , 2001 , p 7 8 ) research consistently reports a strong relationship between social class and perform ance on standardized tests such as the s at many researchers have concluded one avenue through which socio econom ic status affects achievem ent in high school is the acad emic courses the students take historically , h igh schools comm only placed students and organized their curricula by trackin g , where stu dents are p laced in a set of courses based on their perceived educatio nal ability although m any high schools have replaced form al tracking with studen t choice as the m eans by which stu dents are placed in course s , the re lation ship between students choice and their personal backgrounds resem bles that found within traditiona l tracking curricula ( nettles , 2003 , p 217 ) teacher qu ality is an important issu e affecting the achievem ent gap as important as qualified teachers are , the amount of out of field teachers rem ains unacceptably high in 1 999 2000 school year , high poverty ad high m inority schools had between 29 and 34 percent of co re academ ic courses taug ht by ou t of field teach ers poor and m inority students are m ore than twic e as lik ely to s erve as a training ground for inexperienced or uncertif ied teachers as the average ch ild ( jerald , 2002 , pp 1 9 ) 18some solutions for the gap the focus of educatio n should be placed on the ind ividual learner and on an understanding of the learning process it should involve sensitivity to the diverse backgrounds of students and a certain level of connectedness between caring teachers and students t he focus should involve the breakdo wn of fragmented schools and evolve into collaborative efforts between teachers who are no longer isol ated from one another ( mccom bs , 2000 , pp 29 36 ) one school ( francis bacon ) narrowed the achievem ent gap by first focusing on behavior m anagem ent and then researched st rategies for raising academ ic achiev ement the school concluded it is im portant to have high expectati ons for the students and to have a good vehicle for instruction to help the students m eet those expectations collaboratio n between teachers is another important com ponent in im proving the achievem ent gap an isolated teacher can t be successful teacher collaboration and teacher train ing are critical another essen tial elem ent is after school p rogram s that help students to finish their hom ework when students get the right encouragem ent from a caring person , research shows , they ca n defy the odds ( quindlen , 2002 , pp 5 8 ) another im portant aspect in closing the achievem ent gap is comprehensive school reform this includes an overall reorgani zation laying out high expectations and a specific p lan of how the school will ach ieve those expectations a high schoo l in california went through this pr ocess with great success the colleg e board had just 19come out wi th a repo rt that showed a very high correlation between passing algebra and geom etry in high school and later academ ic success so this school d ecided to make this a prim ary target in their reform process math becam e the backbone for the academ ic schedule for th e studen ts ( codding , 2000 , pp 79 92 ) the issue of m inority student s attitudes to ward m ath and science achievem ent is important in reducing the achievem ent ga p and prom oting academ ic success amongst minority stu dents the re is a striking gap between student s expectati ons regarding future careers and their understa nding of the im pact of curre nt course decisions on these plans minority students are less likely to attend schools offering advanced placem ent courses t hese students are m ore likely to encounter negative peer pressure in their decis ions to enroll in m ath and s cience cours es to succeed in advan ced m ath courses , persistence is necessary , whereas , the basic math courses required for everyone can be passed by students who sim ply do t he work these courses are not eno ugh to teach the persistence that is necessary for these student s to becom e successful working in a m ath or science field a recent study showed that student attitudes toward m athem atics are extrem ely important an d play a large part in determining students motiva tion to ward instruction and achievem ent therefore , success in m ath courses and particularly advanced math courses is critical to the academ ic success o f the studen t ( gilroy , 2002 , pp 39 44 ) title 1 , of the elem entary and seconda ry education act of 1965 , ha s had an effect on the achievem ent gap particularly in high poverty contexts during the 1970 s and 1980 s the gap decreased by about two gr ade levels it is assum ed that this 20improve ment was in direct relation to the funding m ade available to counteract poverty , and , thus , continued funding is vital to cont inued im prove ment in the gap between white and black students the im portance of early childhood education and summer learning opportunities for children in poverty situations needs to continue to be an e mphasis of this funding com prehensive school refo rm which focuses on reorganizing and revitalizing the entire school and reducing the student teacher ratio is anot her im portant aspect of this funding ( borm an , 2003 , pp 49 53 ) the minority student achievem ent network is a consortium of 15 school districts with high ac hievem ent levels bu t significant gaps in achievement between white s tudents and their african american or latin o peers they have b anded together to ex amine and evaluate data in an effort to em phasize th e achievem ent of students of color the network agrees wholeh eartedly that the cau ses of the achievem ent gap are neither differences in innate ability nor th e result of biased test questions ( kob er , 2001 ) , and the gap is both com plex and system ic the group is concerned with the fact that the black and latino students with college educ ated parents scored lower on a 12th grade reading test than their white peers whose parents only had a high school diplom a they assert that socioeconom ic factors account for only part of the achievem ent gap the network m embers agree there are m any factors that influence in varying degrees the gap including ( but not lim ited to ) racism , poverty , poor educatio nal leadership , low teacher expectations , negative peer pr essure , etc ( alson , 2003 , pp 76 78 ) 21comprehensive school reform the dom inant strategy for school refor m has hi storically consisted of system ic changes to things like standards , assessm ents , accountability , governance ( vouchers and charters ) , and funding plans these system ic reform s are policies governm ent at the federal , state , or local levels can prescrib e to large num bers of schools these reform s have little direct influence on the methods and m aterials used with in the classroom to ensure success com prehensive school reform shares the goal of systemic school reform improved student achievem ent on a broad scale the difference is com prehensive school reform begins by considering the scho ol as the u nit of reform ultim ately , comprehensive school refor m intends to aff ect every aspect of school functioning the different models vary considerably , but they all aim to af fect cur riculum , instru ction , assessm ent , school organization , necessary support for students having difficulties , parental inv olvem ent , and sustained professiona l developm ent for the staff because this reform begins at the school le vel , staff buy in is cr itical to establish prior to im plem enting the reform ( slavin , 2001 , pp 22 23 ) if a large high school w ith a high pove rty student population has m ajor problem s of absenteeism , low test scores , and high drop out rates , the only solution is a powerful comprehensive school refor m which can turn the school around and keep it strong a comprehensive package of changes establis hing new structures and conditions w hich prom ote positiv e hum an relationsh ips and effec tive learning opportunities is needed in large , high poverty high schools ( jordan , 2000 , pp 159 160 ) 22 the first requirem ent of reform is to create a school en vironm ent which is conducive to learning and to im prove student attendance the school authority m ust be clearly and visibly in charge of discipline , a nd they m ust convey the m essage that this is a real schoo l in which high acad emic achievem ent is expected from all s tuden ts the reform s must prom ote conditions where re spectful and caring re lationships can be developed between teachers and students discipline pr oblem s should fade so that administrato rs can ru le without resentm ent a high prio rity m ust be placed on stu dent attendance so that there is the opportunity to increase lear ning ( jordan , 2000 , p 161 ) high schools that are large and departm entalized are often cited as a contributing factor to a clim ate wher e discipline is weak and studen ts feel estranged from the school the teacher to student ratio is so larg e students who m isbehave can becom e anonymous and escape the regular , effective cont rol of the school ( lee , 1995 , pp 243 245 ) curriculum and instruction m ust be addr essed in com prehens ive schoo l reform the curriculum in large , high poverty sc hools is too often unchallenging and uninteresting usually , lo w level and watered down cour ses are offered to everyone except the advanced , college bound stude nts ( jordan , 2000 , p 162 ) these course offerings continue even though there is a consen sus that m ost students will benefit from a core curriculum with high standards which contains dem anding m aterial ( lucas , 1999 ) classroom instru ction continues to consis t of teacher led lectu res and indiv idual worksheets which em phasize drill and practice of isolated facts and formulas abs ent 23from instruction are stu dent lea rning activi ties which incorporate coop erative learning and project based instruction that encourage a deeper unders tanding of the content and practical applications ( darling hammond , 1997 ) if staff are expected and encouraged to use new curriculum and try new instructional m ethodology , they ne ed to receive high level professional training and direct as sistance with their clas ses curre ntly , most second ary teachers teach and learn alone professional developm ent and training is a necessary com ponent to successful comprehensive school refor m ( jordan , 2000 , pp 162 163 ) talent development model one m odel of com prehensive school reform , called the talent developm ent model , was designed to address the problem of large , urban , nonsel ective high schools it was researched and developed at johns hopkins university and im plemented in patterson high school in baltim ore this schoo l was chosen for the reform s because it represented one of the poorest educa tiona l env ironments in the state of maryland ( jordan , 2000 , p 164 ) the talent developm ent model contains two organizational refor m components the first is the academy structure whic h reduces student apathy and anonym ity by creating sm aller , m ore personalized learn ing co mmunities the upper grades choo se a career focus for their cu rricu lum the second com ponent is the twiligh t school which 24provides recovery opportunities for students with serious disc ipline problem s ( jordan , 2000 , p 165 ) career academy programs high school career academ ies were origina lly designed to address the needs of at risk students one of the suggested reasons that at risk students do not achieve in school is they feel school is irrelevan t to th e real world career academ ies bridge the world of academ ia and the real world of work a car eer academy is a type of com prehensive school reform that has several defining char acteristics the academ y is a school within a school in the high school grad es run by a sm all team of teachers from various discip lines the academ y recruits s tudents who volunteer for the program and demonstrate their comm itment through an ap plication process the career academy focuses on a them e in a field in which demand is growing and good e mploym ent opportunities exist in th e local labor m arket the curr iculum com bines technical and academ ic courses each s emester the academ y includes gen eral em ploym ent skills while keeping the option of attending college open to a ll of its st udents the academ y provides opportunities for students to be em ployed part time during the school year and full tim e during vacation tim es in the field of th eir academ y the career academ y involves representatives from the field of employm ent to help plan and guide the program these repres entatives are invo lved as spea kers , fiel d trip hosts , job supervisors , and m entors for individu al students the academ y contribu tes to the stud ents sense of m embership in a 25caring school community through smaller class sizes than a typical high school , a system of motivation and rewards , and regular contact with their p arents the career acad emy has the capability of utiliz ing funds from a variety of comm unity , governm ent , and business sources a successful career academ y is des igned with these characteristics as a guide ( stern , 1992 ) each academy is self contained they are each led by an adm inistrative team consisting o f an academy principal ( usually an assistant principal ) and an academy instru ctional leade r ( usu ally the dep artment chair of the subject m ost clo sely as sociated with the academ y ) there is one gu idance counselor per academ y to f urther so lidify their unique identities , a cadem ies may selec t banners and mottoes to de corate hallw ays and staircases ( jordan , 2000 , p 166 ) as with any reform move ment , severa l obstacles will exis t that m ust be overcom e career acad emies are n o exception to this rule guidelin es for contro l over the necessary funds to r un a successful career academ y must be establish ed between the school district , funding agencies , and the staff who im plem ent the program apathy amongst the staff must be overcom e or avoide d in order for a fully functional academ y to run ef fectiv ely this must be considered as staf f are c hosen or hired who will be involved in the academy union contract guide lines m ust also be considered in this process full adm inistrative support is a crit ical com ponent i n a career academ y these are som e of the obstacles that m ust be considered and overcom e when im plementing a career acad emy into a high school ( s horr , 1999 , pp 381 382 ) 26 collaboration am ongst the staff is an im portant elem ent in a functioning career academ y comm on planning tim es amongst all the staff in the academ y are necessary so that weekly m eetings can be held to facilitate this collaboration during this m eeting time , the bond between staff can be strengthe ned while instructional , motiva tiona l , and cooperative strategies can be planned ( shorr , 1999 , p 383 ) professional developm ent and training for the staff is another key com ponent for the career academ ies training is necessa ry in order for teachers to le arn to colla borate and educate in a cooperative m anner special train ing is also necessary for teachers to learn to in tegrate th e technology required by the academ y focus into the curricula for each of their classes ( sh orr , 1999 , p 383 ) industry and community partnerships play an important role in a successful career academ y represen tatives from the i ndustry by which the academ y is focused participate as im portant partners in all asp ects o f the career academ y mem bers of the community also can h elp staff m embers m ake addition al connection s with oth er potential indus try participants who did not origin ally share the enthusiasm for becom ing involved with high school students who are consider ed at risk ( shorr , 1999 , pp 383 384 ) in career academ ies , curricu lum is de veloped combining lear ning outcom es from several disciplines with the advantag es of team teaching and com puter technologies the curriculum should be designed them atically to incorporate the technology and principles 27of the career field the academ y is base d upon using technology , teachers can design projec ts bas ed on the te nets of the caree r acade my by utiliz ing com ponents of the caree r academ y such as special speak ers , field trips , mentors , internships , and parents classes are b locked into ad jacen t time perio ds to a llow f or plen ty of tim e to acco mplish the tasks and activ ities associa ted with a m ajor proje ct the projects are design ed in such a way that they lead up to a culm inating senio r project that incorporates all tha t they have learned through their years in th e career academ y this senior project w ould be a large part of a portfolio the students would co mpile to p resent to a f uture em ployer demonstrating the skills and knowledge they have acquired through pa rticipation in the career acad emy ( shorr , 1999 , pp 384 386 ) students follow a block schedule for thei r classes throughout the day students move together from class to class the block typically consum es either the entire morning or afternoon , and the acad emy teachers decide on how to divide up the tim e block sche duling a llows f or more flexibility in c lass length perm itting c lasses to b e longer or shorter , as necessary extra help is available through a vari ety of a venues in the career academ y students who obtain a grade lower than a c must partic ipate in tutoring se ssions occurring before or after school until their grad e rises to a c or better the tutoring is also available to all of the students o n a vol untary basis community volunteers , parents , and retired citizens are recrui ted to w ork as tutors for the students ( shorr , 1999 , p 386 ) 28 a m entoring program in which indus try , com munity , and business people are paired up one on one with a high school student is a part of the career academ y model the m entor works with the student and provide s guidance , instructi on , and an exam ple of how to use education to becom e successful in life a study at colombia university investigated the lives of 100 prom inent am ericans and found that those who cam e from a disadvantaged background were es pecially like ly to c ite the influence of a m entor as a key to their success ( rutherford , 1 998 , pp 78 86 ) a major goal of the m entoring program is to introdu ce the stud ents to the world of work as m any of them com e from poor urban o r imm igrant fa milies ( sh orr , 1999 , p 386 ) the interns hip prog ram is a vital link in the career acad emy between the schoo l training and the labor m arket students are expos ed to the world of work and to a variety of opportunities th at exist in the field they have chosen the com bination of practical experience and educatio nal trai ning provides m otivation to th e studen ts and ensures that they rece ive train ing tha t is com patible with the local labo r market internships usu ally begin as unpaid experiences , but often lead to paid opportunities ( shorr , 1999 , p 388 ) twilight sc hool the other organizational com ponent of the talent developm ent model is the twilight school this is an after hours , on site , short term alternative program for a small group of students who ha ve serious discipline and a ttendance issues twilight school m eets for three hours each day after the regular program is dism issed the 29smaller clas ses are for those students who are coming from juvenile justice in stitutions and court referrals , or for thos e wh o have re gular confrontations with teachers o r other students disturbing the learning env ironm ent for the rest of the class these class es are taught by regular day school faculty who are working on overtim e students in twilight school take three academ ic courses which are th e sam e as da y school courses so that they can return to day school any tim e they are ready ( jordan , 2000 , p 170 ) outcomes o f career academies schools that have im plem

ony to im proved results in several key areas there was an 83 percent graduati on rate for those students w ho com pleted the academ y program compared to 35 percent th at were not in the program the senior project generated enough enthusiasm that 100 percent of participating students com pleted the project satisfactorily more than 65 per cent of the students received scholarsh ips to 2 and 4 year colleges and uni versities ( shorr , 1999 , pp 388 389 ) in other studies of career academ ies , similar positive results were reported attendance rates increased by between 10 and 20 percentage points which probably accounts for the im provem ent in grades and gradu ation rates ( ellio tt , 2002 , p 88 ) 30possible reasons why career academies pro mote higher achievement one of the more obvious reasons career acad emies see m to be effec tive is th e identifiable core of teachers and stu dents that belong to the academ y teachers id entify them selves with the aca demy , regardless of whether they have cl asses containing only academ y students these teachers know who the academ y students are , sh are inform ation about these students , and intens ively tracks these stud ents behavior and absences even m ore so than for ot her non academ y students ( hanser , 2000 , p 33 ) even m ore im portant than the teach ers who identify them selves with the academ y , the students id entify them selves as bei ng a part of a special program students express th eir feelings to ward the academ y as a tight knit , fam ily unit students are aware of the fact that the teachers share infor mation about them and m onitor their progress and developm ent s tudents notice the increased a ttention they receive bot h inside and outside of the classroom they recognize more pos itive comm unication between their teachers and parents w hile the vocational opportuni ties afforded to the students through the career acad emies m ay m otivate studen ts , research indicates that th e nu rturing environm ent offered to students in this atm osphere is the m ajor factor in im proving achievem ent ( elliott , 2002 , pp 88 89 ) 31chapter 3 the effectiveness of c areer acad emies introductio n over the past twen ty ye ars , there has been ex tensive res earch on educatio n reform focusing on the achievem ent gap be tween white and m inority students east high school in colum bus , ohio , an inner city school whose dem ographics are 97 percent african american , has im plemented a possible solutio n to im prove student a chievem ent within the school and to narrow the achievem ent gap between african american and white students the program , which has been im plem ented into four low perform ing high schools in colum bus , is called columbus pathwa ys to success initiative this program is based on research based m odel called th e talent developm ent m odel out of johns hopkins university the com prehensive refo rm model was im plemented at east high school and was structured by high schools that w ork , a non profit com prehensive school reform organization th at is funded by grant m oney columbus pathw ays t o success initiative ( cpsi ) cpsi is a high school refor m model developed in 1999 based on high s chools that w ork and other nationally recognized re form models this initiative is a collabo rative effort between the c olumbus public schools , the colum bus cham ber of comm erce , colum bus educati on association , colum bus sta te comm unity college , and other post s econdary in stitutions it was in itiated by the cham ber of comm erce as an 32effort to dev elop the f uture workf orce with in columbus instead of drawing people from other places the ratio nale for the school system is to im prove the stud ent retention rate and to im

ies , teacher advisem ent program , staff developm ent , public relations , data co llection , analysis , and recomm endat ions high schools that work there are several key pract ices that are adopted by sc hools that follow this m odel of school refor m high sc hools that w ork ( hstw ) is a comprehensive reform grant that works with the school and provides f unding to im plem ent these practices it provides professional developm ent for staff a nd funding for extra positions and program s necessa ry for this reform to be successful there are three goals of hstw the fi rst goal is to in creas e achievem ent in mathematics , science , comm unication , problem solving , and technical skills another goal is to blend the content of traditional co llege preparatory cour ses with quality vocational and technical studies t he third go al is to adv ance policies and leaders hip initiatives necessary to sustain a c ontinuous school im provem ent effort at the high school level , hstw advocates ten key practices e ssential f or refor m to be succe ssful in incr easing stud ent achieve ment the first key practice is setting high 33expectations and getting more and more student s to m eet them incorporating vocational studies into the regula r curricu lum is anothe r key prac tice the em phasis in these studies is using high level m athem atics , science , la nguage arts , and problem solving skills in the modern workplace the academ ic studies shou ld increase student access to academ ics that teach the essen tial concepts fro m the co llege preparato ry curriculu m by incorporating real world problem s and projec ts into the lessons the program of study should be challenging with an upgraded academ ic core an d a m ajor emphasis t he course of study will g ive s tudents and paren ts a system integrating s chool based and work b ased learning t he learning would span across high school and pos t secondary st udies the fifth key practice involves teachers working together o rganizati on , structure , and scheduling should giv e academ ic and vocation al teachers the tim e to plan and deliver integ rated instruc tion a imed at teaching high level content another key practice is getting students actively engaged in rigorous and challenging learning each student and his her parent should receive guidance and advisem ent ensuring the com pletion of a n accelerated program of study the ninth k ey practice is to p rovide a stru ctured system of extra he lp to enable students with inadequate prepara tion to com plete a high le vel program of study the last key practice advocat ed by hstw is to use student assessm ent and evaluation data to con tinuously im prove school clim ate , organization , m anage ment , curriculum , and instruction the purpose of this data analysis is to prom ote student learning and to recognize students who m eet perform ance goals w hen these practices are adhered to , reform is successful , student achievem ent is increased , and the school improves continuously 34the talent development model the talent developm ent model was for mulated at johns hopkins university and implemented into a few high s chools in baltim ore , marylan d this model in corpo rates several components which were adapted and used at east h igh school the two major components originating in the talent devel opment model used at east high school were the ca reer academ ies ( cu rricu lum with a f ocus on future ca reer skills ) and twiligh t school ( an after school program for students who are unable to successfully function in a traditional classroom ) academic emergency as part of t he federal governm ent s education refor m initiative , no child left behind , schools that m eet a certain num ber of criteria are labeled into different categories colum bus public schools and ea st high school was in the lowest category , academ ic em ergency during th e summ er following the 2002 20 03 school year , colum bus public schools were moved out of the academ ic emergency and into the academ ic watch category on the state report card career academies the m odel chosen for continuous im provem ent was career academ ies the m odel organizes large schoo ls into sm aller learning communities called schools within a 35school or academ ies freshm an entering th e school are part of the freshm an success academ y which will be explained in great deta il later in the research upon successful completion of the freshm an year , students ar e required to s elect a career academ y based on their f uture in terests the s tudents hav e four possibilities to choose from which include the following career acad emies h ealth scien ces , arts and communications , ace ( arc hitecture , construction , a nd engineering ) , and team ( technology , engineering , and manufacturing ) the stude nts are then organized by academ y into smaller grou ps who travel togeth er between cl asses and have the sam e team of teachers in their core academ ic classes for three years the classes are all cen tered on the theme of their career academ y , and the stu dents have opportunities at earn ing college credit , experiencing valuable internships , gain ing im portant know how , and learning from a mentor f rom the business community studen ts in the ca reer academ ies will have the opportunity to earn for free up to 45 college credits and will leave high school with the prom ise of a job the career academ y gives focus and purpose to the high school academ ic experien ce architecture , construction , a nd engineering academy ( ace ) the ace academ y focuses prim arily on the building trades as sophomores , the students take typical college preparatory courses in additi on to ele ctives cente red on the trades including an introductory foundation cla ss for the academ y the students have the 36opportunity to take classes to learn such skills as auto cad , m echanical drawing , and basic construction skills after their sophom ore year , students have three options within the ace academ y they m ay choose from one of th e following architectur al civil technology , mechanical technology , or struct ural technology then , dur ing their junior and senior years , the students con tinue to tak e their co llege preparato ry class es at east , but they spend half of their time at a vocational ca reer cente r receiving ha nds on training in a specific trad e the core academ ic classes hav e incorporated into them projects and an emphasis centered on the construction trades students have the opportunity to volunteer their tim e to work on building projects outsi de of the school set ting through habitat for hum anity and other non profit organ izations the academ y has several b usiness partners in the community that provide opportunities for professional de velopm ent , field trips , and special speakers these business partners also provide internship opportunities and mentors for the students during the summ er between their junior and senior years , the students are involved in an internship with a business partner and are enrolled in college classes where they can earn college credit stud ents would choose this academ y if they had an interest in the construction trades , architecture , or engineering upon graduation , having com e through the ace academ y , the students would be ready to enter a post secondary institution in any of the following program s architecture , civil engineering technology , construction m anagem ent , hea ting , ventilation , and air conditioning technology if th eir goals do not incl ude further education , they would be 37adequately prepared for the work force th eir previous work experience would be such that they would qualify for m any jobs requirin g such prev ious experi ence st udent s also have had m any opportunities to m eet and netw ork with people in th e industry the a ce academ y is sponsored by the columbus cha mber of comm erce arts and communication academy the arts and communication ( a c ) acad emy is for those students who are artistically inclined and would en joy creating , perform ing , or writi ng the students in this a cadem y would f ollow a sim ilar colleg e preparatory schedule during their freshma n ( fsa ) and sophom ore year as the students in the ace academ y th eir schedule would include career connections dur ing their freshman year a nd a foundations course during their sophomore year at the end of their sophom ore year , stude nts have the opportunity to choose from three different courses of study to follow during their junior and senior years the first career path is in communications media wh ere they would study m ultimedia , com puter graphics , creative writing , a nd publication t he second career path is the perform ing arts students would study m usic , theatre , and dance ( if availabl e ) the third career path is the visual arts in whic h students would study art , phot ography , and design s tudents in the a c academ y , during their summ ers , ha ve the opportunity to take college classes and take part in an internship 38health sciences academy students in the health s ciences academ y have an interes t in a ca reer in the health industry t hey have strong science aptitude and a desire to work with and help other people their cours e of study will follow a similar route as the other academ ies during their freshman ( fsa ) and sophom ore years these students follow a rigorous science and math curricu lum at the end of their sophom ore year , st uden ts in the health sciences academy have two career paths to choose from in whic h their course of study during their junior and senior y ears will f ollow the f irst car eer pa th is the me dical serv ices which would lead to further education and jobs in nursi ng , lab technicians , ems , or pharm acy the second career path students may choose from is sports and fitness managem ent this path would lead to further education and jobs in sports and fitness m anage ment , or athletic training students in the health sciences academ y also have the opportunity to earn co llege cred it an d take pa rt in intern ships during their summ ers the health sciences academ y is sponsored by the colum bus cha mber of commerce 39technology , engineering , and manufacturing academy ( team ) the technology , engineering , and manuf acturing ( team ) academy is for students who want to receiv e training and education preparing them for careers in designing new products and in the assem bly of the products again , students follow a similar course of study during their freshm an ( fsa ) and sophom ore years as students in the other academ ies students should have st rong aptitude in mathem atics and com puter science they should enjoy working with their hands , understanding how things work , and designing things as with th e other academ ies , students can choose from three different career path s at the end of their sophom ore year the first career path is electronic engineering technology in which students wi ll learn the basics in elec trical technology this path would prepare students to work in the field of electronics or elec trical technology the second career path is computer aided desi gn technology which would train the students in m echanical drafting , com puter aided drafting ( cad ) , and basic m anufacturing and mechanical principles the third career pa th is mechanical e ngineering technology which is sim ilar to th e other two p aths with th e addition o f machining , hydraulics , and robotics the students in the team acad emy also have the opportunities to earn college credit , take part in summ er internsh ips , and have the prom ise of a job upon high school graduation the team academ y is s ponsored by the colum bus cham ber of comm erce 40the freshman succes s academy the resea rch will

cuss values and expectations , and show a prom otional video s howcasing the fsa the vis its are effective in conveying the educational opportunity ava ilable to the student as well as opening 43communication between teachers an d the parent s through out the scho ol year , p arents will receiv e a personal phone cal l twice a m onth from a teacher in the team ( appendix d ) a record of these phone calls is ke pt in a phone log which records what was discussed in each conversation ( appendix j ) at the beginning of the year , the p arents are invited via phone to an open house in wh ich the parents are in troduced to the entire staff , rem inded of expectati ons , and served refreshm ents the importance of academic achievement the cur riculum of the f sa is co llege pr eparatory one of the purposes of the fsa is to improve academ ic achievem ent of th e studen ts there ar e several procedures in place to assist in acco mplishing th is purpose first , th ere is a weekly grade check for the studen ts where each teacher co mmunicates the curren t grade the s tudent has in that class this occurs mon day or tues day of every week , and its purpose is for the students to have current and regular feedb ack in each of their classes in o rder to regu larly evaluate the progress of the freshm an class as a whole , data is collected and evaluated on a weekly b asis ( appen dix e and f ) the d ata in clude s attend ance , parental contact , discipline , and the num ber of st udents with a s or b s and f s at the end of the first semester , students are called in with their parents for a conference with the team of teachers to review a credit check sh eet the credit ch eck s heet ( appen dix b ) is a paper with all of the core courses and electives listed as well as th e grades and credits earned by that student for the first sem ester the teach ers use this opportunity to explain the progress of the student so far , com municat e areas of weak ness wh ere the s tudent m ay 44have fallen behind , and rem ind them of the i mportance of being successf ul in all of their classes as a freshm an for instan ces where th ere are persistent behavioral , academ ic , or social problem s , the team calls an interven tion m eeting the pare nt s attendance is requested by phone , and then te achers and oftentim es the soci al worker m eet with the student strengths of the student are shared and discussed first , followed by a discussion of the problem ( s ) that persist the student is given an opportunity to share any concerns that he she m ight have , and then a plan is laid out to correct the current proble m ( appendix k ) a follow up m eeting is scheduled to discuss progress or the lack th ereof in the sp ecified area another im portant piece in the fsa rega rding academ ic achievem ent is the free extra help that is available to all students math cla sses are double blocked throughout the year to m ake certain that all s tudents r eceive the neces sary instruction to catch them up if necess ary and to ensure su ccess in their future high sch ool math courses there also are availab le career based interven tion ( m ath assistan ce ) clas ses for those who com e into high school lacking the basic m ath skills necess ary to be successful in high school math also available to the students is after school tu toring in all of their core academ ic courses students m ay go as often as they need and stay as long as they need to guarantee that they understand and rem ain caught up in their studies 45attendance policy attendance is a priority in the fsa in order for students to achieve academ ically , they m ust be in school on a regu lar basis th is priority is emphasized in each of th e core academ ic courses by m aking attendance a s ignificant part of the grade received the students receive ten points each day for bei ng in class on tim e which accounts for 15 20 percen t of the overall grade in each class small class si ze a priority of the fsa is to m aintain small class sizes to ensure good individual atten tion for all of the students the teacher to student ratio is 1 25 or sm aller this is also par t of the sm aller le arning com munities accelera tion academy acceleration academ y is an im portan t piece of the reform m odel affecting student achievem ent acceleration academ y is an after h ours safety net p rogram designed to help students who have a difficult tim e adjustin g to high school students can be ass igned , with parental app roval , to the acceleratio n acad emy if they stru ggle 46with attendance , behavio r , or academ ics in th e tradition al daytim e high school class room the class es meet from 2 00 pm until 6 00 pm every day the rationale for the acceleration a cademy is to reduce th e number of distractions f or the other students in the da y program , and to provide the necessa ry skills for these students to b e succ essful in the day program this program provides an alternative environm ent with m ore extens ive support services in order to increase opportunities for student achiev ement as students experience success in this environm ent , the drop out rate is reduced there are m any components that m ake the acceleration academ y unique and successful students will receiv e instruction in m ath , reading language arts , and study skills ther e is also tutoring f or the ohio ni nth grade proficiency tests the student to teacher ratio is no m ore than 1 15 student s are assigned fo r a m andatory m inimum of one sem ester in which they can earn credits , and , if they are successful , they m ay return to the d ay program since the acad emy meets after school , transportatio n is prov ided to students who need it if students return to th e day program , they are m onitored and mentored to ensure a successful return it is possible for st udents to m ake up credits they have previously lost 47summer bridge summ er br idge is ano ther safety ne t program designed to provide reading , math , and study skills to incom ing fr eshm an the rationale for the program is to im prove math and reading skills , im prove study skills for the rigor of high school , and introduce students to post secondary educat ion and career o pportunities there are several im portant component s that m ake up the summer bridge program math and reading a cceleration are com ponents that help to ensure future success in high schoo l with these vital skills study skill techniques are also taught during summ er bridge studen ts receive extra opportun ities to take the proficiency test if they a ttend this p rogram students can atte nd at no cost to them or their parents , and they receive free tran sportation and free breakfas t ohio ninth grade prof iciency tes ts the state o f ohio administers a ninth gr ade proficiency test in the areas of reading , writing , citizenship , mathem atics , a nd science students are required to pass all five parts of the proficiency test in orde r to graduate from high school these tests are a prior ity within th e fsa the thin king is that if a freshm an has passed all or m ost of the tests as a freshm an then their probability of successfully gra duating from high school increases dram atically therefore , a good am ount of tim e is devoted to preparing the students for these p roficiency tes ts in the math classe s , the m ath teachers organ ize the 48students based on whether or not they have passed the m ath profic iency test the students that have not passed the test rem ain in the class room and receive ex tensive instruction and preparation for the test th e students who have already passed the test ( and do not have to take the test again ) go to work on a hands on project that is an extension of the classroom curriculum thes e students have the opportunity to work on projec ts tha t the regula r class room and r outin e would not be able to f acilita te like building balsa wood bridges and w orking with graphing calculators this m akes it possible for the students who need the extra in struction in order to pass the proficiency test get it without boring the st udents who have already passed rewards and motivation another im portan t piece in the fsa i s motivating students on to success and then recognizing them for s uccess there are many different ways in which studen ts are motivated and rewarded for doing the right th ing academ ically and behaviorally in each class , teach ers have tick ets to g ive to students for doing so mething good ( appendix g ) this m ay be som ething as sim ple as answ ering a difficult problem correctly , a ran dom act of kindness , or doing an assigned task well these tickets are st ored in a ticket bin , and each week the teach ers draw fiv e nam es out of the bin the students whose nam es were drawn receiv e the opportunity to choose a prize out o f the prize drawer which is stocked with an assortm ent of prizes su ch as candy , candles , sc hool supplies , m ake up , school spirit item s , etc the teachers are resp onsible for k eeping the p rize drawer well stocked all of the tick ets no t drawn that week then go into a separate bin that will be 49drawn from at the award assem blies for m uch larger prizes such as s weatshirts , dvd players , boom boxes , etc awards ass emblies four tim es per year , after each nine w eek grading period , award assemblies are held to honor student achievem ent ( appendi x h ) once again , pare nts are invited over the phone to attend and see their child receiv e an award at the assembly , awards are handed out recognizing achievem ent in the following categories perfect attendance , outstanding scholar ( honor roll ) , m ost improved student , outstanding student ( exceptional academ ic and behavioral perform ance ) , and 110 percen t ( hardest worker award ) many students may receive a certificate for perform ance in each catego ry , bu t then one s tudent is voted as the overall winner in th at ca tegory by the teach ers the winner receiv es a certificate , a reward ( usually a sweatshirt , pu rse , or som ething sim ilar ) , their p icture on the school web site , and their nam e on a plaque displayed in a trophy case in the hallw ay at school any student that earns a 4 0 ( straigh t a s in all subject areas ) receives a t shirt with their certificate throughout the award assem bly , na mes are drawn from the ticket bin for various prizes the last assembly of the year is a picnic at a p ark near the s chool these assemblies are a celebration of student accom plishment that is e njoyed by parents and students alike 50honor roll students there are special opportuniti es for students who m ake the honor roll for a nine week grading period first , they receiv e a certificate and recognition at the awards assem bly ( appendix i ) secondly , a church in the surrounding neighborhood sponsors a free breakfast for the honor ro ll students in which they in vite special speakers who are both comm unity leaders and east high alum ni finally , they receive the opportunity to participate in the honor roll sponsorship prog ram this program allows each of the honor roll students to choose a fellow stude nt who did not m ake the honor roll with whom to partner if the honor roll student m aintains hi s her honor roll status while pulling their partner up onto th e hon or ro ll , then both s tudents rec eives a free t shirt a nd a pizza p arty this prog ram provides m otivatio n for the students to stay on honor roll while helping a fellow student to achieve this status honor roll is a significant achievem ent , and it should be duly recognized and aspired to hand print s success on the ohio ninth grade proficiency t est is a very im portant aspect in determ ining the su ccess of the fsa therefore , when stud ents achieve in th is area by passing each part of the proficiency test , th ey are afforded the opportunity to be recognized for m any ye ars to com e for each area of the p roficiency test in which the student passes , they place thei r handprint on the wall of the classroom that corresponds to 51the section that they passed ( f or exam ple , if they passed the m ath section , then the y would place their handprint on the wall in th eir m ath classroom ) the handprints will remain on the wall for all to see indefinitely cleveland trip towards the end of the year , the entir e fsa will b e reward ed for their efforts with an all day trip to cleveland the staff a nd students travel to and from cleveland in luxury charter buses in clevel and , they spend the m orning touring a histor ical cem etery and an african am erican m useum then they board a luxury boat fo r a lunch cruise out onto lake erie on the boat , the staff and students are treated to an all you can eat buffet , m usic , and a dj there are academ ic as signm ents aligned with the trip , bu t it is prim arily a reward for a great school year team t shirts as a way of building team pride within the fsa , each year team t shirts are designed e veryone ( staff and students ) are requir ed to purchase one to wear to all of the award assemblies and the cleveland trip th e t shirts can be purchased in orange or black ( school colors ) and have property of east high on the front and the m otivational slogan for the year on back 52 pilgrim me ntoring mentoring program s are anoth er opportuni ty promoting success in the liv es of students in the care er academ y , the student s will re ceive mentoring from a business person , but in the fsa the studen ts are required to becom e a mentor to an elem entary age child who struggles with academ ics pilgri m elementary school is a feeder school for east high school the elem entary school is in academ ic emergency the fsa has instituted a m entoring program in which the ni nth graders a re paired up with a child in the first through sixth grade who is need of help each mo nday afternoon , after school , the ninth graders walk down to pilgrim elementary school to spend 45 m inutes working with a child who is as signed to them for the ye ar during this time , the ch ild m ust spe nd twenty m inutes read ing out loud and writing s entences based on what they have read the ninth graders then work w ith the children on any other school work their child needs to finish the students have established m any strong relationships with their child and are hop efully increas ing their chance of su ccess in the classroom the freshm an do receive community service hours in return which they need for graduation the research process while th ere are several factors th at may contrib ute to the achievem ent gap such as socio econom ic status , lack of fa mily comm unity support , poor sc hool conditions , etc , the research er will focus on the differences betw een the racial disp arities the researcher 53will expla in the overa ll program that has been implem ented and an alyze the results by making two separa te co mparisons the com parisons will ev aluate data that was gath ered during two different academ ic years , 2000 0 1 ( pre acad emy ) and 2002 2003 ( fully functional academ y ) the researcher will an alyze data fro m these years to com pare the results within the schoo l to evaluate the acad emy s effectiveness with in th e scho ol as well as to com pare the result s with the white population with in the state of ohio to evaluate the academ y s effectivenes s in na rrowing the achievem ent gap between white and african am erican students results w ithin the school there are s everal im portant sta tistics that are analyzed to ev aluate the su ccess of the academ y the firs t data set that is ev aluated is the attendanc e rate during the 2000 01 school year , the attendance rate for the fres hman class was 73 percent , and , during the 2002 03 school year , the attendance rate increased to 86 percent results on the ohio 9th grade p roficien cy tes t improved in every subject area significantly between the 2000 01 and 2002 03 school years there was continuous and consistent improvem ent in the rate of stude nts who passed in all five sections of the proficiency test the following chart dem onstrates the progress of passing rates as the academ y model was im plem ented into the schoo l 54ohio 9th

who were first year freshm an at east high school during that school year there is consistent im provem ent in all areas of the proficiency test af ter th e implem entation of the a cadem y model the failure rates decreased in all of the core academ ic subject areas during these same school years as the following chart dem onstrates the percen tages represent the number of s tudents taking the

their freshm an year the m atriculation rate for east high school freshm an improved from 52 percent at the end of the 2001 02 school year to 68 percent at the end of the 2002 03 school year there were som e other statistics that were in dicative of the large n umber of students wh o succeeded in the f s a atm osphere there w ere 180 freshm an enrolled in the f s a of those students , an

ere is a n oticeable g ap between students who attend east high school ( almost exclusively african am erican ) and all the other w hite students in the state of ohio there is a significant decr ease in this achie vement gap during the tim e between the 2000 01 and the 2002 03 school years the gap decreased from 16 percent during the 2000 01 school year to 7 9 per cent during the 2002 03 sc hool

achievem ent gap between w hite and african am erican students as previously stated , the academ y stru cture s ignificantly improved the results in e very a rea within the s chool the results also indicate that the sch ool m ade more progres s in each area when com pared to the other black students in the state of ohio in fact , east high freshm an had considerably m ore students pass each area of the proficiency test in 2002 03 except for the science section in 2002 03 th an did all of the other black students across the state of ohio 59 it is n ecessary to exam ine the effect the academy structu re at east high school had on the achievem ent gap between afri can am erican and w hite studen ts the achievem ent gap decreased in every subject area of the ohio ninth grade proficiency test in fact , in the wr iting section the african american students at east high school surpassed the num ber of w hite students passing this portion of the tes t in read ing , the gap decreased from 25 percent in 2000 01 to 11 pe rcent in 2002 03 in the math section , the achievem ent gap lessened from 44 percent in 2000 01 to 24 percent in 2002 03 in the citiz enship portion of the test , the gap wa s decrea sed by half when it went f rom 32 percent in 2000 01 to 16 per cent in 2002 03 finally , in th e science section , the gap , while it remains very large , did decrease from 48 percent in 2000 01 to 35 percent in 2002 03 t he achievement gap between black and w hite students was reduced , and in one section elim inated , in all areas of the oh io ninth grade p roficiency t est at east h igh school significan ce of the results these results were significant in demons trating the effectiveness of the academ y structure in reducing the achievem ent gap between african a merican and white students t he major change that occurred at east high school between the two years being com pared was th e implem entation and the functionality of the f reshm an suc cess academ y 60chapter 4 perspectives , conclusions , and re commendations there are five different groups of pe ople affected by the academ y model the teachers , th e school adm inistrators , the pare nts , the stu dents , and the researchers perspectives and conclusions from each group will be disclosed perspectives and conclusions of th e teachers the teacher questionn aire ( appendix l ) was given to seven public school teachers wh o were d irectly involv ed with the f reshm an success acad emy at east high school the teachers who shared their responses have been teaching for the following number of years 30 , 1 , 1 , 6 , 15 , 32 , and 7 ther e were two teachers th at indicated they have 6 years experien ce in an academy setting , and the rest had 3 years experience in the academ y structure their respons es will be sh ared question what are the positiv e asp ects , if any , of teaching in an academ y ? the teach er all related how the co mmunity of teachers with shared ex pectations and students allows cross refe rencing and cohesiveness with one another it allows teachers to be unified in dealing w ith achi evement and discipline issu es the co mmon planning tim e is im portant to allow tim e to di scuss concerns the t eachers indicated they learn m uch more about their stud ents in an acad emy setting they said students having the sam e teachers and traveling from class to class with the sam e group of fellow students 61is a positive aspect hav ing comm on goals h elps to unify the teachers su pport is natu ral when the expectations are the s ame another positiv e aspect mentioned is the relationsh ips developed with the o ther teachers that are in th e academ y question what are the negativ e aspect s , if any , of teaching in an acad emy ? many of the teachers indicated that the negative aspects related to tim e issues meetings absorb a large am ount of the t eachers plann ing time throughout the week phone calls every two weeks to a dif ferent gr oup of parents can also take up tim e the other issue that seem ed to reso nate am ong several of the teachers was th at of interpersonal relationships a mong t he team mem bers it takes a large am ount of cooperation , flexibility , and good comm unication in order for the team of teachers to function tog ether cohe sively if a teacher is assigned to this teaching p osition and does not buy in to the concept , they will have a hard tim e worki ng in the team structure there also was m entioned a concern that the o lder , veteran teach ers opinions are not considered and valued as m uch as som e of the younger team members question how does the academ y structu re affect student attend ance and achievem ent ? the teach ers stressed the im portance of the co mmon planning tim e in order to accom plish several goals attendan ce can be ch ecked betwe en teachers on a daily b asis to see which students are attending som e classes but skipping others the tim e together 62enables teachers to have a stronger more unified message to the students the common planning time is also used to bring in pare nts of students who are struggling academ ically or behav iorally and meet with all the teach ers at once the s tudents understand that the teache rs communicate regula rly an d that if th ere is a pro blem there will be a p arent conference either by phone or in person another reason for the incr eased attendance is the pos itive rela tionsh ips that ar e formed be tween the studen ts and the teachers some teachers m entioned that while som e progress h as been m ade in the area of attendance , more work can still be done across the board to improve this area higher achievem ent is encouraged through th e positiv e rew ards recognizing the achievem ent question what advice do you ha ve for other teachers working in an academ y structure ? buying into the conc ept com pletely and comm unicating clearly are the two points of emphasis expressed b y the teach ers if a teacher does not buy in to or agree with the concept of the academ y struc ture , they will b ecome proble matic it is im portant to be a team player and do your part in help ing the academ y to be suc cessful do not be afraid to speak up an d share ideas w hen ideas are com municated , it is im portant to valu e all input from every team member patience is an im portant attribute when working with other people comm unicate , communicate , communicate and work , work , work , were also included in the comments adm inistrative support is a necessary ingredient for a successful academ y 63 question what conclu sions hav e you drawn in regards to the academ y structure at east high school ? the additional support provided to the fres hman is crucial in m aking the transition into high school it only works well if th e teachers bu y into the cooperative work structure of the acad emy it is the best so lution for a very difficult en vironm ent the goals ar e accom plished m uch easier with a u nified team working towards them , but differences in expectatio ns can cause problem s in reaching a consensus beware of old vs young sentim ents or any other issues that can divide rather than unify the team the 4x4 block schedule helps bring academ ic success to the urban setting perspectives and conclusions of th e school administrators the school adm inistrator questionnaire ( appendix m ) was given to tw o public school adm inistrators who are directly invo lved in the freshm an success academ y at east high s chool they are the principal of the sc hool who has been an adm inistrator for 22 years , 15 in an academ y school and 7 in non academ y schools , and the assistant principal responsible for the freshm an who has 13 years , 7 of those years in an academy school , of school adm inistration experience question what are th e critical co mponent s that must be in place with in a schoo l in order for the academ y structure to be successfu l ? 64 1 ) common planning tim e for core academ ic teachers in ev ery academy is essential 2 ) a schedule that works an d is tru e to the academ y model 3 ) a comm itted teach ing staff is essentia l for su ccess teacher buy in and comm itment 4 ) support from the business community 5 ) support from higher education 6 ) work based learning 7 ) mentoring program question what are th e positive aspects , if an y , of the acad emy structure in a school ? the relation ships prom oted in the academ y structure seem s to be the center of many of the positive aspects relating to th is model they inc lude small lear ning communitie s with a common core of caring tea chers in th ese communities , the tea chers and students can work together with a comm on goal there is a p ractical focus for the staff and students mentoring , internships , and college opportunities in a chosen field while the students are still in high school are all positive pa rts of the academ y model also , there is real career exploration that takes place naturally with in the application of the acad emies 65 question what are the negative aspects , if an y , of the academ y structure in a school ? the scheduling is m uch m ore com plicated than the traditional school schedule non cooperative team members can also end up being a negative aspect in the academ y the principal replied that there are no nega tive aspects associated with the ac ademy model question in your ex perien ce , h ow does th e academ y structure affect the attendance and achievem ent of the students ? the teach er stud ent parent relation ship enhan ced in the academ y structure positiv ely a ffects the attendan ce rate there is a f eelin g of togetherness th at is prom oted so , when the academy m odel is im plemented correctly , attendance and achievem ent will sign ificantly im prove question what are your concluding t houghts with regard to the academy school structure ? this is the o nly way to g o in a la rge urban schoo l if studen ts feel welco med and engaged both academ ically and socially , th ey have a m uch greater chance of b eing successful 66 when im plem ented correctly , it is a way of providing students a supportive environm ent that allows them to bridge th e gap between school and the working world it allows for the practical applicati on of the academ ies in a nurturing , caring environm ent perspectives and conclusions of students ten students who had com pleted the freshm an success academ y during th e 2002 03 school year were chosen to receiv e and fill out the stu dent questionnaire ( appendix o ) they w ere also given a copy of the parent surv ey for their parents to fill out they were prom ised a pi zza party at lunch if they re turned th e questionn aires by a certain tim e 8 of the 10 questionnaires we re completed the students included six boys and two girls their responses are summ arized and shared here question describe w hat things you lik ed , if any , about the freshm an success academ y ? there were severa l dif ferent thing s that the students m entioned liking in the freshm en success academ y they enjoyed th e strong relationships that they developed with their freshm an teachers they liked the fact that if they did not understand something academ ically , there was always extra help available they felt the teachers broke things down and m ade them easier to understand learning was m ore fun , and they learn ed more than they have ev er lear ned before the student s also expressed that 67they cou ld get help with things o ther than ju st academ ic issues life issues they really liked the c leveland trip , the p rojects , the end of the y ear p icnic , and the awards assem blies question describe w hat things you did not like , if any , about the freshm an success academ y ? one student expressed that at tim es he did not like the added attention he received h e said , they are always on your back anothe r student m entioned specific teachers they did no t like or with whom they did not get along yet another stu dent expressed they did not like the other students who did not want to learn or do the work and several students said they liked

conclusions from researchers the past year and a half of resear ching both the achievem ent gap existing between african am erican and w hite students and possible solutions for this gap has been encouraging , challenging , and enlighten ing as a teacher of african am erican students , the researcher was challenged on a daily basis by the achievement gap the researcher was forced to evaluate why his st udents achieved at a lower level and what he could do to improve achievem ent in his classr oom the findings , especially relating to the acad emy structure , w ere encou raging in th e results achieved the researcher becam e involved in teachi ng in the freshm an success academ y at east high school at the beginni ng of the 2002 03 school year he had taught at east high school for one year previous to this ex perience and had a total of eight years of teach ing exp erience in an urban setting , it is critical for schools to organize and structure them selves such that the students feel welcom ed and ha ve a sense of belonging the m ajority of students com e into school with m any life issu es that m ake learning m ore difficult therefore , it is im perative for schools to ha ve a strategy for creating a safe and loving environm ent for the students this m akes the concept and model of smaller schools within a s chool ( academy ) a log ical strategy fo r fulfilling th is strategy in order for this model to be successful , there m ust be so me com ponents in place within the school 71adm inistrative support is a critical co mponent in implem enting a successf ul academ y scheduling is more com plex to ensu re that there is a common planning period for all of the teachers within the acad emy as the teachers co me up with creative ideas and integ rative lea rning projec ts , th e adm inistration m ust be willing to work with cha nges in the schedule and other issues that m ay aris e they m ust be willing to allow the ca ring group of teachers to becom e creative in th eir teaching strategies the adm inistration must recogn ize th e prio rity tha t the f reshman year is in helping student s to trans ition into high school and propelling them on to future success the teachers who teach in the acad emy are the k ey to form ing and runnin g a successful academ y te achers m ust buy into th e team concept com pletely and be willing to comm unicate and work closely with the othe r members of the team they m ust truly care for the students they are en trusted to teach they m ust be willing to work above and beyond what the contract requires for the benefit of the students they must be willing to spend extra tim e contacting parents and increa sing their involvem ent the teach ers m ust be comm itted to cre ating an environ ment where the stud ents f eel saf e , loved , and accepted an d still em phasizing the importance of learning w ithout teachers who are comm itted to these thing s , the ac ademy will not function any bette r than a trad itional school the vast m ajority of students with r egular atten dance in the freshm an success academ y experienced academ ic and social success across the board am ongst the freshm an , academ ic achievem ent increased this was ref lected in the incr eased 72attendance rate , increased num ber of stude nts on the honor roll each nine weeks , and increased proficiency test scores the st udents received constant rem inders of what appropriate behavior and co mmunication looked like in th e classroom setting the expectations and consequences for inappropr iate behavior w ere clearly explained on a regular basis as a result , discip line problem s occurred less f requently the researcher has concluded that educat ors need to address the issue of the achievem ent gap between african am erican and w hite students by working to find things th at schools can d o to raise th e achiev ement of all stud ents reg ardless of race educators m ust evaluate the staff , policies , and procedures of th eir schools to see if changes are necessary in order to increas e achiev ement a specific plan must be formulated for each s chool and steps must be taken to im plement and

african american students exists is undisputed the reasons for this gap are many and complex evidence does exist , though , that this gap can be narrowed and potentially eliminated evidence also exists that demonstrates that when the gap in academic achievement becomes equal african americans are more likely to complete college and earn nearly the same income as whites educators must understand the many reasons for the achievement gap and find ways to narrow the gap and further ensure the future success of all students it is the purpose for this thesis to explore the reasons for the achievement gap and some possible solutions for narrowing the gap specifically , the paper will show one possible solution the academy structure table of contentsacknowledgementsmany individuals

test scores , graduation rates , and appears across the curriculum it was narrowing through the decades of the 70 s and 80 s , but , in the 1990 s , the gap has widened somewhat by the end of high school , in fact , african american and latino students have skills in both reading and mathematics that are the same as those of white students in the 8th grade ( haycock , 2001 ) according to the ohio department of education , the data showing 6th graders who met the minimum state performance standards in reading and mathematics proficiency testing for 2000 01 revealed the glaring disparity amongst racial groups in the mathematics section , 68 4 percent of white students met the standard compared to25 8 percent of african american students in reading , 65 3 percent of white students met the standard compared to 25 0 percent of african american students ( gehring , 2002 ) sat scores revealed the continued inequality into the high school age as the average scores for white students on the verbal and math portions were 506 and 514 respectively in 2001 , whereas african american students scored an average of 433 and 426 respectively ( roach , 2001 ) the academic achievement gap between white students and minorities , particularly african americans , is well documented this data calls the researcher to question why this achievement gap exists and persists there appears to be several factors that play a role in establishing the gap some of the factors are student related like poverty , family and community support , and negative peer pressure ( alson , 2003 ) there are also many factors that involve the school s responsibility for the gap which include high standards , a challenging curriculum , extra help for students , teacher quality , and instructional quality the focus of this paper will be the school s role in eliminating or at least narrowing the gap purposethe purpose of the research is to examine the achievement gap between white students and african american students and to evaluate a specific school structure s effectiveness in narrowing the gap the researcher will answer the question does the academy ( school within a school ) structure significantly reduce the achievement gap between african american and white students ? the research will explain the educational challenges facing the african american student and describe some school related solutions for raising the achievement of these students the challenges presented in narrowing the achievement gap and raising equity for all students must be confronted by schools there is much work to be done and several key issues need to be addressed to improve the quality of education at all schools teacher and instructional quality must be a priority especially in high minority school settings where the achievement gap is prevalent schools with the most needs tend to not retain effective teachers and administrators this affects the quality of instructionpresented and facilitates an increasing achievement gap between white and minority students comprehensive school reform is necessary in many cases so that schools get organized in their approaches to counteracting the gap th reform makes possible changes needed in what is taught , how it is taught , and how it is assessed on a school wide instead of class by class level ( codding , 2000 ) comprehensive school reform affects all aspects at all levels of a school including leadership , management , organization , climate , use of money , and use of human resources there are many models for comprehensive school reform , but this research will focus on the academy ( school within a school ) structure and its effectiveness in narrowing the achievement gap methodologyin order to answer the question of the efficiency of various school structures , specifically the academy model , in improving the achievement gap , the paper will begin with an in depth look at the various literature written on the topic of the achievement gap it attempts to read and assimilate the views and information out there regarding this topic it will also attempt to identify possible causes and solutions for the achievement gap the author accessed most of the previously conducted research through the eric database , academic search premier , current journals , and the world wide web the method of research will involve a correlative examination of two ninth grade classes at an urban high school whose demographic makeup consists of approximately 99 percent african american students the classes will be evaluated in terms of state proficiency testing , academic achievement , and attendance the first class evaluated will be the freshman class during the 1999 2000 school year who were a traditional freshman class this will be the control group the second class evaluated will be the freshman class during the 2002 03 school year because they had the full advantages afforded them in an organized , fully functioning academy called the freshman success academy this will be the treatment group both of these classes will be evaluated to see if there is improvement in achievement with the academy , and also if the academy was successful in narrowing the achievement gap between african american and white students biblical integrationgod created every human in a unique and wonderful way his plan was very specific as to the natural characteristics , personalities , aptitudes , and abilities according to psalm 139 13 16 in galatians 3 28 it says , there is neither jew nor greek ( racial differentiation ) , slave nor free ( socioeconomic differentiation ) , male nor female ( gender differentiation ) , for you are all one in christ jesus equity in school is biblical this does not necessarily mean that all students should achieve at the same level as every individual is created uniquely it does suggest that all students should have the same opportunity to achieve the opportunity should include equity in teacher quality , curriculum quality , quality of instruction , and resources that are available theopportunity should be the same for all students regardless of race , gender , or socioeconomic class the education professional must be characterized by excellence because the stakes are so high the profession works everyday with the future lives of children the work done should be completed in such a way that lives are touched everyday and god is glorified through the efforts and the motivations exemplified in the profession colossians 3 23 says , whatever you do , work at it with all your heart , as working for the lord , not for men the teaching profession must have people who are willing to work with all of their hearts in helping all students achieve their fullest potential this is what is honoring to god settingeast high school in columbus , ohio is an urban high school whose population consists of almost all african american students the school has implemented the academy structure in the form of career academies this was accomplished through grant money and an initiative called high schools that work the general model consists of students entering the freshman year in a general college preparatory academy , and then at the end of their freshman year they choose a career academy that lines up with their career goals the model is data driven and involves breaking a large school population up into smaller units comparable to schools within a school teachers collaborate throughout the year by utilizing a common planning period the goal is to cultivate relationships amongst and with the students thatcreate a safe and warm environment for the students the purpose is to increase student achievement summarythe presentation of research will examine the achievement gap existing between white and african american students the reader will come to understand the breadth of the problem as well as many of the factors playing a role in the achievement gap the reader will be presented with many of the issues needing to be addressed by schools in the effort to reach all students and raise achievement the current academy school structure will be evaluated as to whether or not it is a viable vehicle of comprehensive school reform in raising the achievement of african american students to a level more closely paralleling that of white students chapter 2 literature reviewsignificancefor decades researchers have discussed and debated the lower levels of educational achievement of african american compared with white students this achievement gap exists in all school ages even when students arrive at kindergarten , the african american students are considerably behind their white peers in measurable cognitive skills ( nettles , 2003 , p 215 ) there is an endless list of possible reasons for this racial divide in achievement levels ranging from the following linguistic incongruities between home and school culture differing levels of parental involvement lack of cultural and social capital lower general socio economic status divergent study habits and motivational levels the fear of acting white lower teacher expectations , and the quantity and quality of material they are exposed to ( nettles , 2003 , p 216 ) statistics regarding the existence of an achievement gap between 1970 and 1988 , the achievement gap between african american and white students declined continuously until it was cut by fifty percent then , throughout the 1990 s , the achievement gap began to widen again to explain this widening of the gap , it is necessary to closely examine what is going on ( haycock , 2001 , p 6 ) there are several achievement patterns which are worthy of noting in 1999 , 1 in 100 african american 17 year olds can read and gather information from a specialized text ( such as a science article in a magazine ) compared to 1 in 12 white students 1 in 100 african american students can comfortably solve multi step problems compared to about 1 in 10 white students the ratio of african american students to white students who are able to compute fractions , solve percents , and calculate averages was 30 percent to 70 percent in the 18 24 age group , 90 percent of whites have either completed high school or earned a ged while the percentage of african americans drops to 81 approximately 76 percent of white high school graduates go directly to college , while 71 percent of african americans will go african americans are only half as likely to earn a bachelors degree by the age of 29 as whites these statistics do indicate an achievement gap trend between races ( haycock , 2001 , p 7 ) achievement gap statistics for ohio schoolsin ohio , the statistics are just as alarming for example , in 7th grade , only 11 percent of african american students passed all five parts of the states new proficiency test , compared with 43 percent of white students in 2001 , only 59 percent of african american students graduated from high school , compared with 85 percent of white students data released comparing sixth graders were as follows students passing the math proficiency test 68 4 percent of white students and 25 8 percent of african american students and students passing the reading proficiency test 65 3 percent of white students and 25 0 percent of african american students ( gehring , 2002 , pp 20 21 ) also in ohio , 79 percent of white 9th graders performed at or above the passing rate for the ohio 9th grade math proficiency test , compared to only 38 percent of the african american 9th graders this means that 62 percent of african american 9th graders in ohio are not passing , compared to only 21 percent of white 9th graders according to the 2000 national assessment of educational progress ( naep ) , ohio s african american white achievement gap falls 11th among all of the states this puts ohio in the top quartile among states on the naep math assessment ( the education trust , 2003 ) the achievement gap is also apparent in the number of students successfully taking advanced placement ( ap ) courses and the end of the year exams in 2000 2001 , of the students taking ap exams in ohio , 4 percent of the test takers were african american and 89 percent of them were white on the calculus ab exam of the students taking the exam , 31 percent of the african american students earned scores of 3 , 4 , or 5 ( passing scores ) , compared to 69 percent of white students on the ap english language and composition exam , 5 percent of the test takers were african american and 90 percent were white , and , of those who took this exam , the number of passers was similar 31 percent african american and 68 percent white finally , in the ap biology course , 4 percent of the course takers were african american and 85 percent were white the number of students passing the exam was as follows 15 percent of the african american students and 57 percent of the white students passed ( the education trust , 2003 ) data gathered from the sat college achievement test also indicated a gap between african american and white high school seniors on the math portion of the test , the average score in 2001 for white students taking the test was 531 compared to an average score of 426 for african american students the gap is obvious in the average verbal scores as well white students earned a 529 while african americans earned a 433 average score college board president gaston caperton responded to this data saying , the score gaps for different racial , ethnic , and socioeconomic groups that we see on the sat also appear on virtually every measure of achievement , including other standardized tests and classroom grades , and they show up as early as fourth grade these differences are a powerful illustration of a persistent social problem in our country inequitable access to high quality education ( roach , 2001 , p 12 ) according to two international surveys , the trends in international mathematics and science study ( timss ) and the program for international student assessment ( pisa ) , the gap between low achievers and average students persist internationally the gap does not seem to be dependent upon the wealth and prosperity of the country wealthier countries such as portugal , italy , and the united states have a much higher achievement gap than many poorer countries such as south korea the study notes thatstudent achievement seems to be closely linked to the students family backgrounds ( borja , 2002 , p 10 ) data indicates the achievement gap is accompanied by a teacher gap quality counts 2003 is a report , compiled by richard ingersoll of the university of pennsylvania , analyzing public school students access to qualified teachers the data reveals 32 percent of high school students in high poverty schools take a class with a teacher that did not even minor in the subject that he or she teaches , compared to only 22 percent in low poverty schools this percentage increases to more than 50 percent in the middle school grades in high poverty schools , compared to 44 percent in low poverty schools 70 percent of students in low poverty secondary schools have teachers who have both majored in and become licensed in the subjects they teach , compared to about 50 percent of high poverty schools finally , students in high poverty schools are more likely to be taught by less experienced teachers less than 9 percent of teachers in low poverty schools have fewer than 3 years of teaching experience , whereas more than 13 percent of teachers in high poverty schools have little teaching experience ( heimel , 2003 , p 18 ) the issue of white flight to non public schools and its affect on public schools is a possible concern which may be affecting achievement in certain school settings after several statistical analyses , there does seem to be a correlation between the percentage of white students enrolled in non public schools and the concentration of minorities in the public schools secondly , white enrollment does make a difference inthe public schools the black white gap is greater in districts with many whites in non public schools ( bankston , caldas , 2000 , pp 539 550 ) analysis of the statistics historically , african american youth have been thought to have done better if they adopted a eurocentric cultural value system in order for them to achieve , they had to act white the findings of this study were these students showed high self esteem and achievement goals in conjunction with afro centricity the findings revealed that when achievement test scores were the measure of performance , the low scores were associated with the eurocentric racial attitudes on the contrary , high self esteem and achievement goals were associated with an afro centric view of self ( spencer , 2001 , pp 21 30 ) a study was completed that measured the gap between ethnic groups by assessing data on the national assessment of educational progress ( naep ) and sat results it offered an in depth look at the available data on the black white and hispanic white gap in the areas of reading and mathematics it sought to answer the question as to why the gap seemed to decrease in the 1970 s and early 1980 s but then appeared to widen again in the 1990 s the study addresses many factors perceived as reasons for these phenomena such as changes in socioeconomic and family conditions , changes in youth culture and student behaviors , and changes in schooling conditions and practices the study concludes that much ground overall has been covered in narrowing the racial and ethnic gap over the last three decades it appears that many of the gains made duringthe first two decades occurred at the basic skills level and then the gap grew again when the emphasis shifted toward the advanced skills level during the 1980 s the study states that the factors that have been attributed to the gap do not easily explain the current widening of the gap and that further research is necessary across multiple fields of study ( lee , 2002 , pp 3 12 ) another study attempted to identify if after school activities affected achievement of 8th and 10th grade students and students of different ethnicity they looked at the two opposing views on the subject zero sum concept ( extra activities just take time away from students that they should use to study ) and the view that these activities provide an experience that contributes to the overall development of the student the study used the national education longitudinal study ( nels 1988 ) and it included 8th and 10th grade students whose data on the test were complete the study evaluated the students scores in several content areas and categorized the students pursuits on the basis of in or out of school , academic or nonacademic , and organized or nonorganized the study concluded that academic pursuits seemed to be consistently related to achievement , while nonacademic pursuits were not significantly related to achievement these results indicated that the affect was different among differing ethnicities , but it did not go into any depth with this observation ( schreiber , 2002 , pp 10 100 ) another study compares the educational expectations of parents and the influence these expectations have on students of different races the authors differentiate between the whites and the african american hispanic in that the expectations are generallyhigher the exception to this is the african american father due to the lack of a father figure in most cases the conclusion was as follows as we have shown , the aspirations of close relatives and parents , but not those of teachers and peers , have differential effects on students educational expectations , pointing to the importance of examining the unique family and social contexts in which students of different races live in america ( cheng , 2002 , pp 306 327 ) in another study , evidence is described which shows achievement gaps in mathematics between black and white students the study also examined how the socio economic status ( ses ) of the students affects the gap it found ses had little affect in the disparity of achievement levels the gap had narrowed for nearly two decades during the 1970 s and the 1980 s , but started widening again during the 1990 s the researcher evaluated the differences in instructional practices in primarily white and black classrooms the research identified some key differences in instructional belief and practices between teachers of white and black students teachers of white students focused more on reasoning skills and problem solving , whereas teachers of black students focused on single solution and drill based instructional strategies there were also discrepancies found in student course taking and beliefs between these two groups the study concluded there are disparities between black and white students achievement , and this is regardless of their ses status ( lubienski , 2002 , pp 269 287 ) another study took a quantitative approach to show evidence that , for black and white students , environment ( american vs foreign born ) plays a decisive role indetermining their success in precalculus they showed the preparation in later skills ( the math skills most necessary for success in advanced math courses ) was further achieved by those who were foreign born the study involved a sample from a public university in new york with 2 , 005 students who were broken down by gender , ethnicity , age , and birthplace the instrument used was a ceeb elementary algebra skills test the study took place at a four year college they then compared the scores achieved on the test to the grade performance in precalculus the conclusion was that foreign born students were better prepared than american whites , blacks , and hispanics in the later skills therefore , the results point to the environment playing a decisive role in the development of later skills and , thus , subsequent success in precalculus ( baranchik , 2002 , pp 253 267 ) even long after the 1954 u s supreme court decision in brown v board of education , segregated schools continue due to a combination of continued residential segregation and the tradition of neighborhood school assignment over 67 percent of african american students attend majority minority schools and 33 percent attend schools with more than 90 percent minority enrollment on the other hand , over 90 percent of white students attend school in white majority districts this has led to serious negative ramifications for most african american students majority minority school districts have a more difficult time attracting and retaining qualified teachers oftentimes students are not offered access to advanced coursework and information about college entrance requirements ( nettles , 2003 , pp 218 219 ) what students say think about the achievement gap the way students think and feel is important to consider in order to close the achievement gap in math and science , we must first give students the confidence and the opportunities to succeed courses should be offered to prepare students for standardized tests , and the importance of these tests should be emphasized to minority and low income students parent s help and involvement should be solicited as part of their child s education schools should provide summer bridge learning opportunities and mentor programs to link student s educational experiences to the world of work students should be provided with every possible resource and opportunity to help them achieve academic success ( hrabowski , 2003 , pp 44 48 ) good teaching is extremely important and has been shown to impact the achievement of students a study evaluated teachers through the eyes of students in an urban school setting the students interviewed spoke of good teachers who held high expectations for them and held them to that high standard the students stressed the importance of good teaching that results in learning the students also spoke favorably of the block schedule claiming they learned better because the schedule forced teachers to become better at teaching students simply wanted good teachers because such teachers made them learn often in spite of themselves ( corbett , 2002 , pp 18 22 ) oftentimes , minority students are not aware of the perception their school and race achieves far below the standard when the data was revealed to students in a philadelphia inner city school , the students gave the following primary responses as reasons for the lower scores 31 percent indicated the students held themselves responsible , 24 percent referred to teacher behavior , 18 percent indicated their parents role , 13 percent discussed the schools themselves , and 11 percent referred to the students environment or community they also included poverty and peer pressure in their responses the students described teachers as unsupportive they just hand out the work and expect us to do it without doing much teaching the students wanted their parents to take a more active role in being involved in their education the students wanted schools to hold them to higher expectations and provide curriculum that was challenging many of the students felt trapped in their home environment , and they felt that if they tried to improve their performance then they would be perceived as acting white communities and schools must come together , decide what they value for young people , and support that with all of their effort ( taylor , 2003 , pp 72 75 ) identifying the causes for the gap society and adults tend to claim the reasons for the achievement gap between races can be traced back to things outside of the school s control , such as , lack of familial support , low socio economic status , and lack of adequate basic needs ( food , clothing , etc ) students tend to communicate some different sources for the gap , such as , poorly prepared teachers , low expectations , and boring , non challenging curriculum as biggerreasons for the achievement gap the data seems to support what the students are saying it shows that education takes the students who begin with less and systematically give them less in the schools this does not diminish the role outside influences play in the education of students , but , rather , it says that what schools do matters greatly in the lives and education of these disadvantaged students ( haycock , 2001 , p 7 8 ) research consistently reports a strong relationship between social class and performance on standardized tests such as the sat many researchers have concluded one avenue through which socio economic status affects achievement in high school is the academic courses the students take historically , high schools commonly placed students and organized their curricula by tracking , where students are placed in a set of courses based on their perceived educational ability although many high schools have replaced formal tracking with student choice as the means by which students are placed in courses , the relationship between students choice and their personal backgrounds resembles that found within traditional tracking curricula ( nettles , 2003 , p 217 ) teacher quality is an important issue affecting the achievement gap as important as qualified teachers are , the amount of out of field teachers remains unacceptably high in 1999 2000 school year , high poverty ad high minority schools had between 29 and 34 percent of core academic courses taught by out of field teachers poor and minority students are more than twice as likely to serve as a training ground for inexperienced or uncertified teachers as the average child ( jerald , 2002 , pp 1 9 ) some solutions for the gap the focus of education should be placed on the individual learner and on an understanding of the learning process it should involve sensitivity to the diverse backgrounds of students and a certain level of connectedness between caring teachers and students the focus should involve the breakdown of fragmented schools and evolve into collaborative efforts between teachers who are no longer isolated from one another ( mccombs , 2000 , pp 29 36 ) one school ( francis bacon ) narrowed the achievement gap by first focusing on behavior management and then researched strategies for raising academic achievement the school concluded it is important to have high expectations for the students and to have a good vehicle for instruction to help the students meet those expectations collaboration between teachers is another important component in improving the achievement gap an isolated teacher can t be successful teacher collaboration and teacher training are critical another essential element is after school programs that help students to finish their homework when students get the right encouragement from a caring person , research shows , they can defy the odds ( quindlen , 2002 , pp 5 8 ) another important aspect in closing the achievement gap is comprehensive school reform this includes an overall reorganization laying out high expectations and a specific plan of how the school will achieve those expectations a high school in california went through this process with great success the college board had justcome out with a report that showed a very high correlation between passing algebra and geometry in high school and later academic success so this school decided to make this a primary target in their reform process math became the backbone for the academic schedule for the students ( codding , 2000 , pp 79 92 ) the issue of minority student s attitudes toward math and science achievement is important in reducing the achievement gap and promoting academic success amongst minority students there is a striking gap between students expectations regarding future careers and their understanding of the impact of current course decisions on these plans minority students are less likely to attend schools offering advanced placement courses these students are more likely to encounter negative peer pressure in their decisions to enroll in math and science courses to succeed in advanced math courses , persistence is necessary , whereas , the basic math courses required for everyone can be passed by students who simply do the work these courses are not enough to teach the persistence that is necessary for these students to become successful working in a math or science field a recent study showed that student attitudes toward mathematics are extremely important and play a large part in determining students motivation toward instruction and achievement therefore , success in math courses and particularly advanced math courses is critical to the academic success of the student ( gilroy , 2002 , pp 39 44 ) title 1 , of the elementary and secondary education act of 1965 , has had an effect on the achievement gap particularly in high poverty contexts during the 1970 s and 1980 s the gap decreased by about two grade levels it is assumed that thisimprovement was in direct relation to the funding made available to counteract poverty , and , thus , continued funding is vital to continued improvement in the gap between white and black students the importance of early childhood education and summer learning opportunities for children in poverty situations needs to continue to be an emphasis of this funding comprehensive school reform which focuses on reorganizing and revitalizing the entire school and reducing the student teacher ratio is another important aspect of this funding ( borman , 2003 , pp 49 53 ) the minority student achievement network is a consortium of 15 school districts with high achievement levels but significant gaps in achievement between white students and their african american or latino peers they have banded together to examine and evaluate data in an effort to emphasize the achievement of students of color the network agrees wholeheartedly that the causes of the achievement gap are neither differences in innate ability nor the result of biased test questions ( kober , 2001 ) , and the gap is both complex and systemic the group is concerned with the fact that the black and latino students with college educated parents scored lower on a 12th grade reading test than their white peers whose parents only had a high school diploma they assert that socioeconomic factors account for only part of the achievement gap the network members agree there are many factors that influence in varying degrees the gap including ( but not limited to ) racism , poverty , poor educational leadership , low teacher expectations , negative peer pressure , etc ( alson , 2003 , pp 76 78 ) comprehensive school reformthe dominant strategy for school reform has historically consisted of systemic changes to things like standards , assessments , accountability , governance ( vouchers and charters ) , and funding plans these systemic reforms are policies government at the federal , state , or local levels can prescribe to large numbers of schools these reforms have little direct influence on the methods and materials used within the classroom to ensure success comprehensive school reform shares the goal of systemic school reform improved student achievement on a broad scale the difference is comprehensive school reform begins by considering the school as the unit of reform ultimately , comprehensive school reform intends to affect every aspect of school functioning the different models vary considerably , but they all aim to affect curriculum , instruction , assessment , school organization , necessary support for students having difficulties , parental involvement , and sustained professional development for the staff because this reform begins at the school level , staff buy in is critical to establish prior to implementing the reform ( slavin , 2001 , pp 22 23 ) if a large high school with a high poverty student population has major problems of absenteeism , low test scores , and high drop out rates , the only solution is a powerful comprehensive school reform which can turn the school around and keep it strong a comprehensive package of changes establishing new structures and conditions which promote positive human relationships and effective learning opportunities is needed in large , high poverty high schools ( jordan , 2000 , pp 159 160 ) the first requirement of reform is to create a school environment which is conducive to learning and to improve student attendance the school authority must be clearly and visibly in charge of discipline , and they must convey the message that this is a real school in which high academic achievement is expected from all students the reforms must promote conditions where respectful and caring relationships can be developed between teachers and students discipline problems should fade so that administrators can rule without resentment a high priority must be placed on student attendance so that there is the opportunity to increase learning ( jordan , 2000 , p 161 ) high schools that are large and departmentalized are often cited as a contributing factor to a climate where discipline is weak and students feel estranged from the school the teacher to student ratio is so large students who misbehave can become anonymous and escape the regular , effective control of the school ( lee , 1995 , pp 243 245 ) curriculum and instruction must be addressed in comprehensive school reform the curriculum in large , high poverty schools is too often unchallenging and uninteresting usually , low level and watered down courses are offered to everyone except the advanced , college bound students ( jordan , 2000 , p 162 ) these course offerings continue even though there is a consensus that most students will benefit from a core curriculum with high standards which contains demanding material ( lucas , 1999 ) classroom instruction continues to consist of teacher led lectures and individual worksheets which emphasize drill and practice of isolated facts and formulas absentfrom instruction are student learning activities which incorporate cooperative learning and project based instruction that encourage a deeper understanding of the content and practical applications ( darling hammond , 1997 ) if staff are expected and encouraged to use new curriculum and try new instructional methodology , they need to receive high level professional training and direct assistance with their classes currently , most secondary teachers teach and learn alone professional development and training is a necessary component to successful comprehensive school reform ( jordan , 2000 , pp 162 163 ) talent development modelone model of comprehensive school reform , called the talent development model , was designed to address the problem of large , urban , nonselective high schools it was researched and developed at johns hopkins university and implemented in patterson high school in baltimore this school was chosen for the reforms because it represented one of the poorest educational environments in the state of maryland ( jordan , 2000 , p 164 ) the talent development model contains two organizational reform components the first is the academy structure which reduces student apathy and anonymity by creating smaller , more personalized learning communities the upper grades choose a career focus for their curriculum the second component is the twilight school whichprovides recovery opportunities for students with serious discipline problems ( jordan , 2000 , p 165 ) career academy programshigh school career academies were originally designed to address the needs of at risk students one of the suggested reasons that at risk students do not achieve in school is they feel school is irrelevant to the real world career academies bridge the world of academia and the real world of work a career academy is a type of comprehensive school reform that has several defining characteristics the academy is a school within a school in the high school grades run by a small team of teachers from various disciplines the academy recruits students who volunteer for the program and demonstrate their commitment through an application process the career academy focuses on a theme in a field in which demand is growing and good employment opportunities exist in the local labor market the curriculum combines technical and academic courses each semester the academy includes general employment skills while keeping the option of attending college open to all of its students the academy provides opportunities for students to be employed part time during the school year and full time during vacation times in the field of their academy the career academy involves representatives from the field of employment to help plan and guide the program these representatives are involved as speakers , field trip hosts , job supervisors , and mentors for individual students the academy contributes to the students sense of membership in acaring school community through smaller class sizes than a typical high school , a system of motivation and rewards , and regular contact with their parents the career academy has the capability of utilizing funds from a variety of community , government , and business sources a successful career academy is designed with these characteristics as a guide ( stern , 1992 ) each academy is self contained they are each led by an administrative team consisting of an academy principal ( usually an assistant principal ) and an academy instructional leader ( usually the department chair of the subject most closely associated with the academy ) there is one guidance counselor per academy to further solidify their unique identities , academies may select banners and mottoes to decorate hallways and staircases ( jordan , 2000 , p 166 ) as with any reform movement , several obstacles will exist that must be overcome career academies are no exception to this rule guidelines for control over the necessary funds to run a successful career academy must be established between the school district , funding agencies , and the staff who implement the program apathy amongst the staff must be overcome or avoided in order for a fully functional academy to run effectively this must be considered as staff are chosen or hired who will be involved in the academy union contract guidelines must also be considered in this process full administrative support is a critical component in a career academy these are some of the obstacles that must be considered and overcome when implementing a career academy into a high school ( shorr , 1999 , pp 381 382 ) collaboration amongst the staff is an important element in a functioning career academy common planning times amongst all the staff in the academy are necessary so that weekly meetings can be held to facilitate this collaboration during this meeting time , the bond between staff can be strengthened while instructional , motivational , and cooperative strategies can be planned ( shorr , 1999 , p 383 ) professional development and training for the staff is another key component for the career academies training is necessary in order for teachers to learn to collaborate and educate in a cooperative manner special training is also necessary for teachers to learn to integrate the technology required by the academy focus into the curricula for each of their classes ( shorr , 1999 , p 383 ) industry and community partnerships play an important role in a successful career academy representatives from the industry by which the academy is focused participate as important partners in all aspects of the career academy members of the community also can help staff members make additional connections with other potential industry participants who did not originally share the enthusiasm for becoming involved with high school students who are considered at risk ( shorr , 1999 , pp 383 384 ) in career academies , curriculum is developed combining learning outcomes from several disciplines with the advantages of team teaching and computer technologies the curriculum should be designed thematically to incorporate the technology and principlesof the career field the academy is based upon using technology , teachers can design projects based on the tenets of the career academy by utilizing components of the career academy such as special speakers , field trips , mentors , internships , and parents classes are blocked into adjacent time periods to allow for plenty of time to accomplish the tasks and activities associated with a major project the projects are designed in such a way that they lead up to a culminating senior project that incorporates all that they have learned through their years in the career academy this senior project would be a large part of a portfolio the students would compile to present to a future employer demonstrating the skills and knowledge they have acquired through participation in the career academy ( shorr , 1999 , pp 384 386 ) students follow a block schedule for their classes throughout the day students move together from class to class the block typically consumes either the entire morning or afternoon , and the academy teachers decide on how to divide up the time block scheduling allows for more flexibility in class length permitting classes to be longer or shorter , as necessary extra help is available through a variety of avenues in the career academy students who obtain a grade lower than a c must participate in tutoring sessions occurring before or after school until their grade rises to a c or better the tutoring is also available to all of the students on a voluntary basis community volunteers , parents , and retired citizens are recruited to work as tutors for the students ( shorr , 1999 , p 386 ) a mentoring program in which industry , community , and business people are paired up one on one with a high school student is a part of the career academy model the mentor works with the student and provides guidance , instruction , and an example of how to use education to become successful in life a study at colombia university investigated the lives of 100 prominent americans and found that those who came from a disadvantaged background were especially likely to cite the influence of a mentor as a key to their success ( rutherford , 1998 , pp 78 86 ) a major goal of the mentoring program is to introduce the students to the world of work as many of them come from poor urban or immigrant families ( shorr , 1999 , p 386 ) the internship program is a vital link in the career academy between the school training and the labor market students are exposed to the world of work and to a variety of opportunities that exist in the field they have chosen the combination of practical experience and educational training provides motivation to the students and ensures that they receive training that is compatible with the local labor market internships usually begin as unpaid experiences , but often lead to paid opportunities ( shorr , 1999 , p 388 ) twilight schoolthe other organizational component of the talent development model is the twilight school this is an after hours , on site , short term alternative program for a small group of students who have serious discipline and attendance issues twilight school meets for three hours each day after the regular program is dismissed thesmaller classes are for those students who are coming from juvenile justice institutions and court referrals , or for those who have regular confrontations with teachers or other students disturbing the learning environment for the rest of the class these classes are taught by regular day school faculty who are working on overtime students in twilight school take three academic courses which are the same as day school courses so that they can return to day school any time they are ready ( jordan , 2000 , p 170 ) outcomes of career academiesschools that have implemented career academies have reported positive results hollywood high school , in hollywood , ca , ( 78 percent minority population and 85 percent free or reduced lunch population ) gives testimony to improved results in several key areas there was an 83 percent graduation rate for those students who completed the academy program compared to 35 percent that were not in the program the senior project generated enough enthusiasm that 100 percent of participating students completed the project satisfactorily more than 65 percent of the students received scholarships to 2 and 4 year colleges and universities ( shorr , 1999 , pp 388 389 ) in other studies of career academies , similar positive results were reported attendance rates increased by between 10 and 20 percentage points which probably accounts for the improvement in grades and graduation rates ( elliott , 2002 , p 88 ) possible reasons why career academies promote higher achievementone of the more obvious reasons career academies seem to be effective is the identifiable core of teachers and students that belong to the academy teachers identify themselves with the academy , regardless of whether they have classes containing only academy students these teachers know who the academy students are , share information about these students , and intensively tracks these students behavior and absences even more so than for other non academy students ( hanser , 2000 , p 33 ) even more important than the teachers who identify themselves with the academy , the students identify themselves as being a part of a special program students express their feelings toward the academy as a tight knit , family unit students are aware of the fact that the teachers share information about them and monitor their progress and development students notice the increased attention they receive both inside and outside of the classroom they recognize more positive communication between their teachers and parents while the vocational opportunities afforded to the students through the career academies may motivate students , research indicates that the nurturing environment offered to students in this atmosphere is the major factor in improving achievement ( elliott , 2002 , pp 88 89 ) chapter 3 the effectiveness of career academiesintroductionover the past twenty years , there has been extensive research on education reform focusing on the achievement gap between white and minority students east high school in columbus , ohio , an inner city school whose demographics are 97 percent african american , has implemented a possible solution to improve student achievement within the school and to narrow the achievement gap between african american and white students the program , which has been implemented into four low performing high schools in columbus , is called columbus pathways to success initiative this program is based on research based model called the talent development model out of johns hopkins university the comprehensive reform model was implemented at east high school and was structured by high schools that work , a non profit comprehensive school reform organization that is funded by grant money columbus pathways to success initiative ( cpsi ) cpsi is a high school reform model developed in 1999 based on high schools that work and other nationally recognized reform models this initiative is a collaborative effort between the columbus public schools , the columbus chamber of commerce , columbus education association , columbus state community college , and other post secondary institutions it was initiated by the chamber of commerce as aneffort to develop the future workforce within columbus instead of drawing people from other places the rationale for the school system is to improve the student retention rate and to improve student achievement there are several components within the cpsi which include the following freshman success academy , acceleration academy , a summer bridge program , career academies , teacher advisement program , staff development , public relations , data collection , analysis , and recommendations high schools that workthere are several key practices that are adopted by schools that follow this model of school reform high schools that work ( hstw ) is a comprehensive reform grant that works with the school and provides funding to implement these practices it provides professional development for staff and funding for extra positions and programs necessary for this reform to be successful there are three goals of hstw the first goal is to increase achievement in mathematics , science , communication , problem solving , and technical skills another goal is to blend the content of traditional college preparatory courses with quality vocational and technical studies the third goal is to advance policies and leadership initiatives necessary to sustain a continuous school improvement effort at the high school level , hstw advocates ten key practices essential for reform to be successful in increasing student achievement the first key practice is setting highexpectations and getting more and more students to meet them incorporating vocational studies into the regular curriculum is another key practice the emphasis in these studies is using high level mathematics , science , language arts , and problem solving skills in the modern workplace the academic studies should increase student access to academics that teach the essential concepts from the college preparatory curriculum by incorporating real world problems and projects into the lessons the program of study should be challenging with an upgraded academic core and a major emphasis the course of study will give students and parents a system integrating school based and work based learning the learning would span across high school and post secondary studies the fifth key practice involves teachers working together organization , structure , and scheduling should give academic and vocational teachers the time to plan and deliver integrated instruction aimed at teaching high level content another key practice is getting students actively engaged in rigorous and challenging learning each student and his her parent should receive guidance and advisement ensuring the completion of an accelerated program of study the ninth key practice is to provide a structured system of extra help to enable students with inadequate preparation to complete a high level program of study the last key practice advocated by hstw is to use student assessment and evaluation data to continuously improve school climate , organization , management , curriculum , and instruction the purpose of this data analysis is to promote student learning and to recognize students who meet performance goals when these practices are adhered to , reform is successful , student achievement is increased , and the school improves continuously the talent development modelthe talent development model was formulated at johns hopkins university and implemented into a few high schools in baltimore , maryland this model incorporates several components which were adapted and used at east high school the two major components originating in the talent development model used at east high school were the career academies ( curriculum with a focus on future career skills ) and twilight school ( an after school program for students who are unable to successfully function in a traditional classroom ) academic emergencyas part of the federal government s education reform initiative , no child left behind , schools that meet a certain number of criteria are labeled into different categories columbus public schools and east high school was in the lowest category , academic emergency during the summer following the 2002 2003 school year , columbus public schools were moved out of the academic emergency and into the academic watch category on the state report card career academiesthe model chosen for continuous improvement was career academies the model organizes large schools into smaller learning communities called schools within aschool or academies freshman entering the school are part of the freshman success academy which will be explained in great detail later in the research upon successful completion of the freshman year , students are required to select a career academy based on their future interests the students have four possibilities to choose from which include the following career academies health sciences , arts and communications , ace ( architecture , construction , and engineering ) , and team ( technology , engineering , and manufacturing ) the students are then organized by academy into smaller groups who travel together between classes and have the same team of teachers in their core academic classes for three years the classes are all centered on the theme of their career academy , and the students have opportunities at earning college credit , experiencing valuable internships , gaining important know how , and learning from a mentor from the business community students in the career academies will have the opportunity to earn for free up to 45 college credits and will leave high school with the promise of a job the career academy gives focus and purpose to the high school academic experience architecture , construction , and engineering academy ( ace ) the ace academy focuses primarily on the building trades as sophomores , the students take typical college preparatory courses in addition to electives centered on the trades including an introductory foundation class for the academy the students have theopportunity to take classes to learn such skills as auto cad , mechanical drawing , and basic construction skills after their sophomore year , students have three options within the ace academy they may choose from one of the following architectural civil technology , mechanical technology , or structural technology then , during their junior and senior years , the students continue to take their college preparatory classes at east , but they spend half of their time at a vocational career center receiving hands on training in a specific trade the core academic classes have incorporated into them projects and an emphasis centered on the construction trades students have the opportunity to volunteer their time to work on building projects outside of the school setting through habitat for humanity and other non profit organizations the academy has several business partners in the community that provide opportunities for professional development , field trips , and special speakers these business partners also provide internship opportunities and mentors for the students during the summer between their junior and senior years , the students are involved in an internship with a business partner and are enrolled in college classes where they can earn college credit students would choose this academy if they had an interest in the construction trades , architecture , or engineering upon graduation , having come through the ace academy , the students would be ready to enter a post secondary institution in any of the following programs architecture , civil engineering technology , construction management , heating , ventilation , and air conditioning technology if their goals do not include further education , they would beadequately prepared for the work force their previous work experience would be such that they would qualify for many jobs requiring such previous experience students also have had many opportunities to meet and network with people in the industry the ace academy is sponsored by the columbus chamber of commerce arts and communication academythe arts and communication ( a c ) academy is for those students who are artistically inclined and would enjoy creating , performing , or writing the students in this academy would follow a similar college preparatory schedule during their freshman ( fsa ) and sophomore year as the students in the ace academy their schedule would include career connections during their freshman year and a foundations course during their sophomore year at the end of their sophomore year , students have the opportunity to choose from three different courses of study to follow during their junior and senior years the first career path is in communications media where they would study multimedia , computer graphics , creative writing , and publication the second career path is the performing arts students would study music , theatre , and dance ( if available ) the third career path is the visual arts in which students would study art , photography , and design students in the a c academy , during their summers , have the opportunity to take college classes and take part in an internship health sciences academystudents in the health sciences academy have an interest in a career in the health industry they have strong science aptitude and a desire to work with and help other people their course of study will follow a similar route as the other academies during their freshman ( fsa ) and sophomore years these students follow a rigorous science and math curriculum at the end of their sophomore year , students in the health sciences academy have two career paths to choose from in which their course of study during their junior and senior years will follow the first career path is the medical services which would lead to further education and jobs in nursing , lab technicians , ems , or pharmacy the second career path students may choose from is sports and fitness management this path would lead to further education and jobs in sports and fitness management , or athletic training students in the health sciences academy also have the opportunity to earn college credit and take part in internships during their summers the health sciences academy is sponsored by the columbus chamber of commerce technology , engineering , and manufacturing academy ( team ) the technology , engineering , and manufacturing ( team ) academy is for students who want to receive training and education preparing them for careers in designing new products and in the assembly of the products again , students follow a similar course of study during their freshman ( fsa ) and sophomore years as students in the other academies students should have strong aptitude in mathematics and computer science they should enjoy working with their hands , understanding how things work , and designing things as with the other academies , students can choose from three different career paths at the end of their sophomore year the first career path is electronic engineering technology in which students will learn the basics in electrical technology this path would prepare students to work in the field of electronics or electrical technology the second career path is computer aided design technology which would train the students in mechanical drafting , computer aided drafting ( cad ) , and basic manufacturing and mechanical principles the third career path is mechanical engineering technology which is similar to the other two paths with the addition of machining , hydraulics , and robotics the students in the team academy also have the opportunities to earn college credit , take part in summer internships , and have the promise of a job upon high school graduation the team academy is sponsored by the columbus chamber of commerce the freshman success academythe research will focus on the freshman success academy ( fsa ) the fsa is a self contained school within a school organized around interdisciplinary teams of teachers designed to provide incoming freshman a smooth transition to high school the rationale for the fsa is to improve student attendance , improve academic success , reduce the drop out rate , and instruction focused on career education there are many components that are incorporated into a successful fsa teacher buy inin order for the fsa to be successful , teachers must buy in to the collaborative effort teachers must be willing to work as a team to accomplish common goals oftentimes , teachers in the academy setting will be required to go above and beyond the contractual expectations of a teacher general hiring and interview practices ensure that new members of the team do buy in , but it is crucial for current staff members to cooperate with the team concept lead teachersthe lead teacher of the academy plays an important role in the success of the academy they communicate regularly with both school administration and district administration in order to ensure the academy is functioning and achieving itsexpectations the lead teacher accomplishes this by attending all scheduled district wide and school lead teacher administrator meetings the lead teacher of the academy provides necessary leadership within the academy they clarify team goals and priorities they facilitate the collection and team analysis of data the lead teachers plan agendas , coordinate team meetings and documentation of activities they coordinate all team activities and staff development for team members teacher collaborationcollaboration amongst the team of teachers is a key part in the fsa the team of teachers involved in the fsa work together very closely in standardizing the experience of the students in all of their classes in order to facilitate this collaboration , the teachers share a common planning time in which they meet at least twice a week to coordinate their plans ( appendix c ) the teachers have a common syllabus ( appendix a ) that outlines common expectations , a common grading scale , the teaching philosophies and objectives of each course there are ten core values that are posted in a visible and creative way in each classroom these values are emphasized , taught , and adhered to in every classroom as what the behavioral expectations are several times throughout the school year the teachers map and integrate their curriculum they plan cross curricular projects and activities so that the students receive different academic perspectives on the same project or learning unit small learning communitiesthe fsa is organized into small learning communities , called teams , in which students travel in groups to the same classes with the same team of teachers the academy has a designated location within the building so the students spend the majority of the day in the same section of the school the fsa is located primarily in the basement of the high school career connectionsevery freshman within the academy takes an elective course called career connections this course offers the students an overview of possible careers as well as different career development activities the course is an introduction to the career focused education that is a key component in the academy model communication with parentscommunication with the parents is emphasized within the fsa to open up this communication , teachers participate in home visits during the summer prior to the school year during these visits , teachers share the student s schedules , discuss values and expectations , and show a promotional video showcasing the fsa the visits are effective in conveying the educational opportunity available to the student as well as openingcommunication between teachers and the parents throughout the school year , parents will receive a personal phone call twice a month from a teacher in the team ( appendix d ) a record of these phone calls is kept in a phone log which records what was discussed in each conversation ( appendix j ) at the beginning of the year , the parents are invited via phone to an open house in which the parents are introduced to the entire staff , reminded of expectations , and served refreshments the importance of academic achievementthe curriculum of the fsa is college preparatory one of the purposes of the fsa is to improve academic achievement of the students there are several procedures in place to assist in accomplishing this purpose first , there is a weekly grade check for the students where each teacher communicates the current grade the student has in that class this occurs monday or tuesday of every week , and its purpose is for the students to have current and regular feedback in each of their classes in order to regularly evaluate the progress of the freshman class as a whole , data is collected and evaluated on a weekly basis ( appendix e and f ) the data includes attendance , parental contact , discipline , and the number of students with a s or b s and f s at the end of the first semester , students are called in with their parents for a conference with the team of teachers to review a credit check sheet the credit check sheet ( appendix b ) is a paper with all of the core courses and electives listed as well as the grades and credits earned by that student for the first semester the teachers use this opportunity to explain the progress of the student so far , communicate areas of weakness where the student mayhave fallen behind , and remind them of the importance of being successful in all of their classes as a freshman for instances where there are persistent behavioral , academic , or social problems , the team calls an intervention meeting the parent s attendance is requested by phone , and then teachers and oftentimes the social worker meet with the student strengths of the student are shared and discussed first , followed by a discussion of the problem ( s ) that persist the student is given an opportunity to share any concerns that he she might have , and then a plan is laid out to correct the current problem ( appendix k ) a follow up meeting is scheduled to discuss progress or the lack thereof in the specified area another important piece in the fsa regarding academic achievement is the free extra help that is available to all students math classes are double blocked throughout the year to make certain that all students receive the necessary instruction to catch them up if necessary and to ensure success in their future high school math courses there also are available career based intervention ( math assistance ) classes for those who come into high school lacking the basic math skills necessary to be successful in high school math also available to the students is after school tutoring in all of their core academic courses students may go as often as they need and stay as long as they need to guarantee that they understand and remain caught up in their studies attendance policyattendance is a priority in the fsa in order for students to achieve academically , they must be in school on a regular basis this priority is emphasized in each of the core academic courses by making attendance a significant part of the grade received the students receive ten points each day for being in class on time which accounts for 15 20 percent of the overall grade in each class small class sizea priority of the fsa is to maintain small class sizes to ensure good individual attention for all of the students the teacher to student ratio is 1 25 or smaller this is also part of the smaller learning communities acceleration academyacceleration academy is an important piece of the reform model affecting student achievement acceleration academy is an after hours safety net program designed to help students who have a difficult time adjusting to high school students can be assigned , with parental approval , to the acceleration academy if they strugglewith attendance , behavior , or academics in the traditional daytime high school classroom the classes meet from 2 00 pm until 6 00 pm every day the rationale for the acceleration academy is to reduce the number of distractions for the other students in the day program , and to provide the necessary skills for these students to be successful in the day program this program provides an alternative environment with more extensive support services in order to increase opportunities for student achievement as students experience success in this environment , the drop out rate is reduced there are many components that make the acceleration academy unique and successful students will receive instruction in math , reading language arts , and study skills there is also tutoring for the ohio ninth grade proficiency tests the student to teacher ratio is no more than 1 15 students are assigned for a mandatory minimum of one semester in which they can earn credits , and , if they are successful , they may return to the day program since the academy meets after school , transportation is provided to students who need it if students return to the day program , they are monitored and mentored to ensure a successful return it is possible for students to make up credits they have previously lost summer bridgesummer bridge is another safety net program designed to provide reading , math , and study skills to incoming freshman the rationale for the program is to improve math and reading skills , improve study skills for the rigor of high school , and introduce students to post secondary education and career opportunities there are several important components that make up the summer bridge program math and reading acceleration are components that help to ensure future success in high school with these vital skills study skill techniques are also taught during summer bridge students receive extra opportunities to take the proficiency test if they attend this program students can attend at no cost to them or their parents , and they receive free transportation and free breakfast ohio ninth grade proficiency teststhe state of ohio administers a ninth grade proficiency test in the areas of reading , writing , citizenship , mathematics , and science students are required to pass all five parts of the proficiency test in order to graduate from high school these tests are a priority within the fsa the thinking is that if a freshman has passed all or most of the tests as a freshman then their probability of successfully graduating from high school increases dramatically therefore , a good amount of time is devoted to preparing the students for these proficiency tests in the math classes , the math teachers organize thestudents based on whether or not they have passed the math proficiency test the students that have not passed the test remain in the classroom and receive extensive instruction and preparation for the test the students who have already passed the test ( and do not have to take the test again ) go to work on a hands on project that is an extension of the classroom curriculum these students have the opportunity to work on projects that the regular classroom and routine would not be able to facilitate like building balsa wood bridges and working with graphing calculators this makes it possible for the students who need the extra instruction in order to pass the proficiency test get it without boring the students who have already passed rewards and motivationanother important piece in the fsa is motivating students on to success and then recognizing them for success there are many different ways in which students are motivated and rewarded for doing the right thing academically and behaviorally in each class , teachers have tickets to give to students for doing something good ( appendix g ) this may be something as simple as answering a difficult problem correctly , a random act of kindness , or doing an assigned task well these tickets are stored in a ticket bin , and each week the teachers draw five names out of the bin the students whose names were drawn receive the opportunity to choose a prize out of the prize drawer which is stocked with an assortment of prizes such as candy , candles , school supplies , make up , school spirit items , etc the teachers are responsible for keeping the prize drawer well stocked all of the tickets not drawn that week then go into a separate bin that will bedrawn from at the award assemblies for much larger prizes such as sweatshirts , dvd players , boom boxes , etc awards assembliesfour times per year , after each nine week grading period , award assemblies are held to honor student achievement ( appendix h ) once again , parents are invited over the phone to attend and see their child receive an award at the assembly , awards are handed out recognizing achievement in the following categories perfect attendance , outstanding scholar ( honor roll ) , most improved student , outstanding student ( exceptional academic and behavioral performance ) , and 110 percent ( hardest worker award ) many students may receive a certificate for performance in each category , but then one student is voted as the overall winner in that category by the teachers the winner receives a certificate , a reward ( usually a sweatshirt , purse , or something similar ) , their picture on the school web site , and their name on a plaque displayed in a trophy case in the hallway at school any student that earns a 4 0 ( straight a s in all subject areas ) receives a t shirt with their certificate throughout the award assembly , names are drawn from the ticket bin for various prizes the last assembly of the year is a picnic at a park near the school these assemblies are a celebration of student accomplishment that is enjoyed by parents and students alike honor roll studentsthere are special opportunities for students who make the honor roll for a nine week grading period first , they receive a certificate and recognition at the awards assembly ( appendix i ) secondly , a church in the surrounding neighborhood sponsors a free breakfast for the honor roll students in which they invite special speakers who are both community leaders and east high alumni finally , they receive the opportunity to participate in the honor roll sponsorship program this program allows each of the honor roll students to choose a fellow student who did not make the honor roll with whom to partner if the honor roll student maintains his her honor roll status while pulling their partner up onto the honor roll , then both students receives a free t shirt and a pizza party this program provides motivation for the students to stay on honor roll while helping a fellow student to achieve this status honor roll is a significant achievement , and it should be duly recognized and aspired to hand printssuccess on the ohio ninth grade proficiency test is a very important aspect in determining the success of the fsa therefore , when students achieve in this area by passing each part of the proficiency test , they are afforded the opportunity to be recognized for many years to come for each area of the proficiency test in which the student passes , they place their handprint on the wall of the classroom that corresponds tothe section that they passed ( for example , if they passed the math section , then they would place their handprint on the wall in their math classroom ) the handprints will remain on the wall for all to see indefinitely cleveland triptowards the end of the year , the entire fsa will be rewarded for their efforts with an all day trip to cleveland the staff and students travel to and from cleveland in luxury charter buses in cleveland , they spend the morning touring a historical cemetery and an african american museum then they board a luxury boat for a lunch cruise out onto lake erie on the boat , the staff and students are treated to an all you can eat buffet , music , and a dj there are academic assignments aligned with the trip , but it is primarily a reward for a great school year team t shirtsas a way of building team pride within the fsa , each year team t shirts are designed everyone ( staff and students ) are required to purchase one to wear to all of the award assemblies and the cleveland trip the t shirts can be purchased in orange or black ( school colors ) and have property of east high on the front and the motivational slogan for the year on back pilgrim mentoringmentoring programs are another opportunity promoting success in the lives of students in the career academy , the students will receive mentoring from a business person , but in the fsa the students are required to become a mentor to an elementary age child who struggles with academics pilgrim elementary school is a feeder school for east high school the elementary school is in academic emergency the fsa has instituted a mentoring program in which the ninth graders are paired up with a child in the first through sixth grade who is need of help each monday afternoon , after school , the ninth graders walk down to pilgrim elementary school to spend 45 minutes working with a child who is assigned to them for the year during this time , the child must spend twenty minutes reading out loud and writing sentences based on what they have read the ninth graders then work with the children on any other school work their child needs to finish the students have established many strong relationships with their child and are hopefully increasing their chance of success in the classroom the freshman do receive community service hours in return which they need for graduation the research processwhile there are several factors that may contribute to the achievement gap such as socio economic status , lack of family community support , poor school conditions , etc , the researcher will focus on the differences between the racial disparities the researcherwill explain the overall program that has been implemented and analyze the results by making two separate comparisons the comparisons will evaluate data that was gathered during two different academic years , 2000 01 ( pre academy ) and 2002 2003 ( fully functional academy ) the researcher will analyze data from these years to compare the results within the school to evaluate the academy s effectiveness within the school as well as to compare the results with the white population within the state of ohio to evaluate the academy s effectiveness in narrowing the achievement gap between white and african american students results within the schoolthere are several important statistics that are analyzed to evaluate the success of the academy the first data set that is evaluated is the attendance rate during the 2000 01 school year , the attendance rate for the freshman class was 73 percent , and , during the 2002 03 school year , the attendance rate increased to 86 percent results on the ohio 9th grade proficiency test improved in every subject area significantly between the 2000 01 and 2002 03 school years there was continuous and consistent improvement in the rate of students who passed in all five sections of the proficiency test the following chart demonstrates the progress of passing rates as the academy model was implemented into the school ohio 9th grade proficiency test scoresthese results represent students who were first year freshman at east high school during that school year there is consistent improvement in all areas of the proficiency test after the implementation of the academy model the failure rates decreased in all of the core academic subject areas during these same school years as the following chart demonstrates the percentages represent the number of students taking the course that earned a failing grade and , therefore did not receive credit for this required course failure ratesthe decreasing number of failures , combined with the improved attendance rate and improved success on the proficiency tests , were a large factor in improving the matriculation rate the matriculation rate for the freshman success academy is defined as the number of students who received enough credits to make them legitimate sophomores at the end of their freshman year the matriculation rate for east high school freshman improved from 52 percent at the end of the 2001 02 school year to 68 percent at the end of the 2002 03 school year there were some other statistics that were indicative of the large number of students who succeeded in the f s a atmosphere there were 180 freshman enrolled in the f s a of those students , an average of 7 percent earned a 4 0 g p a ( straight a s ) each of the nine week grading periods an average of 15 percent earned at least a 3 5g p a each nine week grading period an average of 44 percent earned at least a 3 0each nine week grading period which placed them on the school s honor roll these numbers indicate that a large number of students thrived while enrolled in the f s a statistics comparing east high school with the state of ohio disaggregated by racethe following statistics were generated through the ohio department of education website the website makes available data and a statistic generating program called microstrategy this program contains data from the state of ohio , ohio s schools , and school districts , and it allows generation of comparative statistics the address for the website is www ilrc ode state oh us microstrategy attendance rates results disaggregated by raceattendance rate building and district east high school s racial composition is almost 100 blackattendance rate state of ohiothe achievement gap is not obviously reflected in the attendance rates at the district and state level there is a noticeable gap between students who attend east high school ( almost exclusively african american ) and all the other white students in the state of ohio there is a significant decrease in this achievement gap during the time between the 2000 01 and the 2002 03 school years the gap decreased from 16 percent during the 2000 01 school year to 7 9 percent during the 2002 03 school year the increase in attendance at east high school may partially account for the increased academic achievement proficiency results disaggregated by racethe following chart shows the results of all five parts of the ohio ninth grade proficiency tests for 2000 01 and 2002 03 it compares the freshman students attendingeast high school ( comprised of almost all african americans ) with both the black and white students across the state of ohio the results indicate that gains were made over these years in decreasing the achievement gap between white and african american students as previously stated , the academy structure significantly improved the results in every area within the school the results also indicate that the school made more progress in each area when compared to the other black students in the state of ohio in fact , east high freshman had considerably more students pass each area of the proficiency test in 2002 03 except for the science section in 2002 03 than did all of the other black students across the state of ohio it is necessary to examine the effect the academy structure at east high school had on the achievement gap between african american and white students the achievement gap decreased in every subject area of the ohio ninth grade proficiency test in fact , in the writing section the african american students at east high school surpassed the number of white students passing this portion of the test in reading , the gap decreased from 25 percent in 2000 01 to 11 percent in 2002 03 in the math section , the achievement gap lessened from 44 percent in 2000 01 to 24 percent in 2002 03 in the citizenship portion of the test , the gap was decreased by half when it went from 32 percent in 2000 01 to 16 percent in 2002 03 finally , in the science section , the gap , while it remains very large , did decrease from 48 percent in 2000 01 to 35 percent in 2002 03 the achievement gap between black and white students was reduced , and in one section eliminated , in all areas of the ohio ninth grade proficiency test at east high school significance of the resultsthese results were significant in demonstrating the effectiveness of the academy structure in reducing the achievement gap between african american and white students the major change that occurred at east high school between the two years being compared was the implementation and the functionality of the freshman success academy chapter 4 perspectives , conclusions , and recommendationsthere are five different groups of people affected by the academy model the teachers , the school administrators , the parents , the students , and the researchers perspectives and conclusions from each group will be disclosed perspectives and conclusions of the teachersthe teacher questionnaire ( appendix l ) was given to seven public school teachers who were directly involved with the freshman success academy at east high school the teachers who shared their responses have been teaching for the following number of years 30 , 1 , 1 , 6 , 15 , 32 , and 7 there were two teachers that indicated they have 6 years experience in an academy setting , and the rest had 3 years experience in the academy structure their responses will be shared question what are the positive aspects , if any , of teaching in an academy ? the teacher all related how the community of teachers with shared expectations and students allows cross referencing and cohesiveness with one another it allows teachers to be unified in dealing with achievement and discipline issues the common planning time is important to allow time to discuss concerns the teachers indicated they learn much more about their students in an academy setting they said students having the same teachers and traveling from class to class with the same group of fellow studentsis a positive aspect having common goals helps to unify the teachers support is natural when the expectations are the same another positive aspect mentioned is the relationships developed with the other teachers that are in the academy question what are the negative aspects , if any , of teaching in an academy ? many of the teachers indicated that the negative aspects related to time issues meetings absorb a large amount of the teachers planning time throughout the week phone calls every two weeks to a different group of parents can also take up time the other issue that seemed to resonate among several of the teachers was that of interpersonal relationships among the team members it takes a large amount of cooperation , flexibility , and good communication in order for the team of teachers to function together cohesively if a teacher is assigned to this teaching position and does not buy in to the concept , they will have a hard time working in the team structure there also was mentioned a concern that the older , veteran teachers opinions are not considered and valued as much as some of the younger team members question how does the academy structure affect student attendance and achievement ? the teachers stressed the importance of the common planning time in order to accomplish several goals attendance can be checked between teachers on a daily basis to see which students are attending some classes but skipping others the time togetherenables teachers to have a stronger more unified message to the students the common planning time is also used to bring in parents of students who are struggling academically or behaviorally and meet with all the teachers at once the students understand that the teachers communicate regularly and that if there is a problem there will be a parent conference either by phone or in person another reason for the increased attendance is the positive relationships that are formed between the students and the teachers some teachers mentioned that while some progress has been made in the area of attendance , more work can still be done across the board to improve this area higher achievement is encouraged through the positive rewards recognizing the achievement question what advice do you have for other teachers working in an academy structure ? buying into the concept completely and communicating clearly are the two points of emphasis expressed by the teachers if a teacher does not buy in to or agree with the concept of the academy structure , they will become problematic it is important to be a team player and do your part in helping the academy to be successful do not be afraid to speak up and share ideas when ideas are communicated , it is important to value all input from every team member patience is an important attribute when working with other people communicate , communicate , communicate and work , work , work , were also included in the comments administrative support is a necessary ingredient for a successful academy question what conclusions have you drawn in regards to the academy structure at east high school ? the additional support provided to the freshman is crucial in making the transition into high school it only works well if the teachers buy into the cooperative work structure of the academy it is the best solution for a very difficult environment the goals are accomplished much easier with a unified team working towards them , but differences in expectations can cause problems in reaching a consensus beware of old vs young sentiments or any other issues that can divide rather than unify the team the 4x4 block schedule helps bring academic success to the urban setting perspectives and conclusions of the school administratorsthe school administrator questionnaire ( appendix m ) was given to two public school administrators who are directly involved in the freshman success academy at east high school they are the principal of the school who has been an administrator for 22 years , 15 in an academy school and 7 in non academy schools , and the assistant principal responsible for the freshman who has 13 years , 7 of those years in an academy school , of school administration experience question what are the critical components that must be in place within a school in order for the academy structure to be successful ? common planning time for core academic teachers in every academy is essential a schedule that works and is true to the academy model a committed teaching staff is essential for success teacher buy in and commitment support from the business community support from higher education work based learning mentoring program question what are the positive aspects , if any , of the academy structure in a school ? the relationships promoted in the academy structure seems to be the center of many of the positive aspects relating to this model they include small learning communities with a common core of caring teachers in these communities , the teachers and students can work together with a common goal there is a practical focus for the staff and students mentoring , internships , and college opportunities in a chosen field while the students are still in high school are all positive parts of the academy model also , there is real career exploration that takes place naturally within the application of the academies question what are the negative aspects , if any , of the academy structure in a school ? the scheduling is much more complicated than the traditional school schedule non cooperative team members can also end up being a negative aspect in the academy the principal replied that there are no negative aspects associated with the academy model question in your experience , how does the academy structure affect the attendance and achievement of the students ? the teacher student parent relationship enhanced in the academy structure positively affects the attendance rate there is a feeling of togetherness that is promoted so , when the academy model is implemented correctly , attendance and achievement will significantly improve question what are your concluding thoughts with regard to the academy school structure ? this is the only way to go in a large urban school if students feel welcomed and engaged both academically and socially , they have a much greater chance of being successful when implemented correctly , it is a way of providing students a supportive environment that allows them to bridge the gap between school and the working world it allows for the practical application of the academies in a nurturing , caring environment perspectives and conclusions of studentsten students who had completed the freshman success academy during the 2002 03 school year were chosen to receive and fill out the student questionnaire ( appendix o ) they were also given a copy of the parent survey for their parents to fill out they were promised a pizza party at lunch if they returned the questionnaires by a certain time 8 of the 10 questionnaires were completed the students included six boys and two girls their responses are summarized and shared here question describe what things you liked , if any , about the freshman success academy ? there were several different things that the students mentioned liking in the freshmen success academy they enjoyed the strong relationships that they developed with their freshman teachers they liked the fact that if they did not understand something academically , there was always extra help available they felt the teachers broke things down and made them easier to understand learning was more fun , and they learned more than they have ever learned before the students also expressed thatthey could get help with things other than just academic issues life issues they really liked the cleveland trip , the projects , the end of the year picnic , and the awards assemblies question describe what things you did not like , if any , about the freshman success academy ? one student expressed that at times he did not like the added attention he received he said , they are always on your back another student mentioned specific teachers they did not like or with whom they did not get along yet another student expressed they did not like the other students who did not want to learn or do the work and several students said they liked everything about the freshman success academy question do you feel that the freshman success academy prepared you to be successful in high school ? explain only one student responded no to this question she said that the work was too easy , and that they weren t given the opportunity to work on their own like they have to as sophomores the other seven students responded with yeses for various reasons one student said that the academy allowed the majority of the freshman to mature and become respectful of teachers another student said the teachers explained everything that goes on in high school and the importance of their grades in the college process very well another student made reference to the extra help available when he had trouble understanding several of the students simply said they learned a lot question what would you change , if anything , about the freshman success academy ? one student replied that she would let the freshman students work more independently another student wanted to change the t shirts the other six students said that they would not change anything perspectives and conclusions of parentsthe parent questionnaire ( appendix n ) was delivered to each parent by their child who was also filling out the student questionnaire therefore , i received back eight parent questionnaires which contained four questions each the first three questions the parent simply had to circle a response out of the following choices i strongly agree , i agree , i disagree , or undecided the fourth question allowed them to share any comments they had regarding the freshman success academy their responses are shared question did you feel as if you were regularly contacted regarding your child s progress ? for this question , there were six parents who circled i strongly agree , one parent who circled i agree , and one parent who circled i disagree question did you feel more involved in your child s education ? on this question , there were five parents who circle i strongly agree , two parents who circled i agree , and one parent who circled i disagree question did you think your child s academic achievement improved in the freshman success academy ? for this question , there were three parents that circled i strongly agree , four parents that circled i agree , and again one parent that circled i disagree question do you have any comments regarding your child s experience in the freshman success academy ? one parent had a few negative comments questioning the amount of contact he received from the teachers at regular intervals he said that he would like earlier notification if his son is not performing well in a class he also questioned how students were assigned to particular classes two parents commented on the great teachers in the freshman success academy the other five parents did not make any comments perspectives and conclusions from researchersthe past year and a half of researching both the achievement gap existing between african american and white students and possible solutions for this gap has been encouraging , challenging , and enlightening as a teacher of african american students , the researcher was challenged on a daily basis by the achievement gap the researcher was forced to evaluate why his students achieved at a lower level and what he could do to improve achievement in his classroom the findings , especially relating to the academy structure , were encouraging in the results achieved the researcher became involved in teaching in the freshman success academy at east high school at the beginning of the 2002 03 school year he had taught at east high school for one year previous to this experience and had a total of eight years of teaching experience in an urban setting , it is critical for schools to organize and structure themselves such that the students feel welcomed and have a sense of belonging the majority of students come into school with many life issues that make learning more difficult therefore , it is imperative for schools to have a strategy for creating a safe and loving environment for the students this makes the concept and model of smaller schools within a school ( academy ) a logical strategy for fulfilling this strategy in order for this model to be successful , there must be some components in place within the school administrative support is a critical component in implementing a successful academy scheduling is more complex to ensure that there is a common planning period for all of the teachers within the academy as the teachers come up with creative ideas and integrative learning projects , the administration must be willing to work with changes in the schedule and other issues that may arise they must be willing to allow the caring group of teachers to become creative in their teaching strategies the administration must recognize the priority that the freshman year is in helping students to transition into high school and propelling them on to future success the teachers who teach in the academy are the key to forming and running a successful academy teachers must buy into the team concept completely and be willing to communicate and work closely with the other members of the team they must truly care for the students they are entrusted to teach they must be willing to work above and beyond what the contract requires for the benefit of the students they must be willing to spend extra time contacting parents and increasing their involvement the teachers must be committed to creating an environment where the students feel safe , loved , and accepted and still emphasizing the importance of learning without teachers who are committed to these things , the academy will not function any better than a traditional school the vast majority of students with regular attendance in the freshman success academy experienced academic and social success across the board amongst the freshman , academic achievement increased this was reflected in the increasedattendance rate , increased number of students on the honor roll each nine weeks , and increased proficiency test scores the students received constant reminders of what appropriate behavior and communication looked like in the classroom setting the expectations and consequences for inappropriate behavior were clearly explained on a regular basis as a result , discipline problems occurred less frequently the researcher has concluded that educators need to address the issue of the achievement gap between african american and white students by working to find things that schools can do to raise the achievement of all students regardless of race educators must evaluate the staff , policies , and procedures of their schools to see if changes are necessary in order to increase achievement a specific plan must be formulated for each school and steps must be taken to implement and fulfill this plan the implementation process must be evaluated and tweaked on a regular basis to make sure that the achievement of students remains the priority through each phase of reform staff who are not committed to this priority must be moved on if possible our goal as educators should be that there is truly no child left behind appendix acourse title expectations and syllabusteacher s
